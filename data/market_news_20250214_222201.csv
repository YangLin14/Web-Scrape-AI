79593751,Apple Faces Delays in Siri AI Overhaul Due to Engineering Challenges,"Apple's planned extensive upgrades to Siri are encountering engineering issues and software bugs, potentially delaying or limiting the functionality of these en","Apple's planned extensive upgrades to Siri are encountering engineering issues and software bugs, potentially delaying or limiting the functionality of these enhancements. The company initially unveiled its new AI-driven Siri plans at a developer conference, promoting features aimed at improving user interaction. However, insiders now report that Apple is racing to complete the software, with some features initially planned for April potentially being postponed until May or later. Last year, Apple announced three major improvements for Siri: better utilization of user data to provide more accurate responses and actions, a new system for precise app control, and the ability to use contextual information from the device's screen to enhance user service. These were intended to be part of the iOS 18.4 release. Nevertheless, Apple is now considering delaying or limiting certain functionalities until the release of iOS 18.5, or alternatively, introducing the features in April's release but keeping them disabled until automatically activated in the subsequent update.",gurufocus.com,https://www.gurufocus.com/news/2700365/apple-faces-delays-in-siri-ai-overhaul-due-to-engineering-challenges,"['aapl', 'ne-ws']","['Aapl', 'Article', 'Gurufocus', 'Gurufocus News', 'News', 'Stock', 'Technology', 'Unknown Sector']",2025-02-14,2025-02-14,2,8,68,160,1076

79593749,Bedford art show aims to bring 'new technology to the masses',Colour and Light at The Higgins Bedford will draw on the influence of generations of painters.,"Exhibition showcases art through virtual reality - Published The organisers of an art exhibition will draw on the influences of painters through the generations to ""bring new technology and digital art to the masses"". Colour and Light, at The Higgins Bedford, will showcase artwork through the ages, from JMW Turner to pop artist Peter Blake and Chila Kumari Burman. Dr Alison Goodyear, a Bedford-based artist, said she was able to create ""innovative, ground-breaking"" work with people who did not believe they were ""arty"". ""We're looking at historical paintings through the lens of contemporary expanding painting practice, we're not ignoring what has gone before - we're seeing it in a new light,"" she said. ""It shows how digital art can be all things,"" she added. Dr Goodyear worked with four community groups - the Higgins volunteers, Queen's Park Youth Group, Castle Art Life Group and a team of Ukrainian artists - on the show. She said many believed they were ""not artists or arty, but I disagree with that, everyone has the potential to be an artist"". Working with a virtual reality (VR) assistant, Amina Pagliari, the groups were shown how to create VR together in an ""immersive space"". What they created was edited into a 26-minute animated film which will be projected on to a wall within the exhibition. Dr Goodyear said: ""I felt like a virtual explorer flying around the space creating a film path to capture the content. ""The goal is to bring new technology and digital art to the masses, in a way that hasn't been done before."" Victoria Partridge, keeper of fine and decorative art at the museum, said three of its nine Turner paintings would be on display, including ""one of his most famous watercolours, A First Rate Taking in Stores"". The piece Cecil and Kali, painted by the renowned artist Chila Kumari Singh Burman, will also be exhibited, as it was created while Burman was artist in residence in 2003. ""It's a fascinating new way at looking at art through virtual reality,"" Ms Partridge added. The exhibition is supported by Arts Council England, opens on 15 February and runs until 2 November.

79593736,"Castle, Knecht lead team to Rising Stars championship, All-Star tournament",Candace Parker will coach the fourth and final team in the All-Star tournament.,"SAN FRANCISCO — Rising stars usually have to wait their turn to step on the big stage. They play on All-Star Weekend before it’s technically the weekend, a Friday night preview of future greatness from the NBA’s finest collection of precocious novices. But things changed on Valentine’s Day in the Bay. The NBA’s response to the recent embarrassment that is the All-Star Game on Sunday was a new mini-tournament format introduced this season. The All-Star rosters were divided into three teams of eight,[ managed by Inside the NBA’s crew](https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/6119935/2025/02/10/nba-all-star-tournament-draft-lebron-james/) of Charles Barkley, Shaquille O’Neal and Kenny Smith. Advertisement The fourth entrant to Sunday evening’s All-Star tournament is the winner of the Rising Stars championship, who will be coached by TNT analyst Candace Parker. In a preview of Sunday’s All-Star tournament, the Rising Stars group was also divided into three squads. A fourth entrant comprised of G League players completed the bracket and took down the Thompson twins in the first round. Ultimately, Stephon Castle and Dalton Knecht led Team C to victory, becoming the first rising stars team to compete against the league’s biggest names. “About to play my first All-Star Game. That’s crazy as a rookie,” Knecht said. “It’s going to be a lot of fun. We are going to try to go out there and put on a show and try to make it competitive for sure. We’re going to try to get that win.” The Rising Stars tournament had an initial round of two games, with the winner being the first to score 40 points. That created a quick and competitive environment that eliminated a lot of the listless play that has plagued All-Star weekend over the past decade. Though the chance to appear in the big game Sunday was a motivator, the league structuring these games in a more efficient and competitive manner made for a better product. “I think it’s going to bring a whole new dynamic,” Miami Heat wing Jamie Jaquez Jr. said. “I think (it’s) a new energy, a new life to this All-Star Weekend.” This isn’t just an opportunity for the usual rising stars that eventually go on to be key starters for competitive teams around the league. This also was the rare chance for G Leaguers to play on the national stage. “Man, I’m grateful to be out here, blessed to be out here,” said JD Davison, guard for the G League’s Maine Celtics. “Just to show people I can compete with the big dogs, not only from a competitive standpoint, but just to show people I can make shots and defend at a high level.” Advertisement But the big question was whether this tournament structure, and the chance to play in the All-Star Game(s), would get these players to compete hard. “For sure. We were just trying to go out there and win,” Knecht said. “It took us a while to get warm in that second game. But once we got going, we felt just comfortable. We were swinging the ball, everyone was touching it, and just shooting it with confidence.” GO DEEPER The NBA can tinker with the All-Star Game all it wants, but there's only one way to fix it It was a good thing Knecht’s squad figured it out quickly, because just about everyone was surprised about halfway through the championship game, when they realized the target score to win was just 25. “That timeout where we were up 12 to 8, I looked up and saw it (was to) 25 and I was like, ‘Oh snap, I didn’t know what was going on,’” Davison said. “Then they came out and didn’t miss. So I guess they knew.” Castle, the San Antonio Spurs guard, led the way in the championship game and received the MVP award after his team finished on a 17-2 run. Castle was asked if he has his eyes on the rare All-Star Weekend trifecta, going for the Rising Stars MVP, Dunk Contest championship and then All-Star tournament MVP. “I’ve definitely thought about it. I want to take it one step at a time, though,” Castle said. “Maybe get back to me tomorrow after I win the Dunk Contest.” With the way his rookie season is going, Castle could become a fixture at All-Star weekend down the road. But not everyone involved in this game has had a smooth rookie campaign. Knecht was recently traded to the Charlotte Hornets for center Mark Williams, only to be sent back to the Lakers when they[ rescinded the trade](https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/6133430/2025/02/13/lakers-dalton-knecht-return-hornets-trade/) following Williams’ medical review. It’s an awkward situation having to come back to a team who decided to move on from you, but Knecht is making the best of an awkward situation. “What I told those guys when I got back is I just want to play basketball. That’s what I love to do,” Knecht said. “That’s like the only thing I love to do, is play basketball.” Advertisement He’ll be able to get some of that tension out of his system, saying he’s looking forward to going up against his teammate LeBron James, looking to make a statement. But as excited as he is for that moment, it’s still hard to process. It remains to be seen if this novel approach to All-Star weekend will make a difference with the audience, but the players are enjoying it. “It hasn’t sunk in yet,” Knecht said. “Going up against the All-Stars is going to be a lot of fun. I watched a lot of it growing up as a kid. So now I’m a part of it.” Required reading (Photo: Joe Murphy / NBAE via Getty Images)",nytimes.com,https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/6138106/2025/02/15/rising-stars-tournament-nba-all-star-weekend/,[],['Nba'],2025-02-14,2025-02-14,0,1,74,79,5373

79593713,‘Jet-like flame’: E-bike batteries fuel Sydney boarding house fire,Investigators are looking into whether lithium e-bike batteries were the cause of a fire that led to 20 people evacuating a boarding house in Sydney’s inner west.,"Investigators are looking into whether lithium e-bike batteries were the cause of a large boarding house fire in Sydney’s inner west on Saturday morning that left one man hospitalised. Twenty people had fled the property when Fire and Rescue NSW responded at about 6.10am to reports of a fire at a boarding house on Fort Street in Petersham. More than 20 firefighters with six trucks worked to extinguish the blaze within an hour. A NSW Ambulance spokeswoman confirmed a 51-year-old man had been transported to Sydney Hospital after suffering minor burns and was in a stable condition. Some of the occupants who self-evacuated when the fire started have since been able to return to their lodgings. Fire and Rescue superintendent Adam Dewberry said it was not yet clear if the blaze, which started on the ground floor, began as an electrical fire. He said investigations were focusing on lithium-ion e-bike batteries around the area, which had contributed to the fire’s rapid spread and intensity, causing numerous minor explosions. “The batteries go into thermal runaway and explode,” he said. “They have a jet-like flame that comes out of them.” Police established a crime scene but a spokesperson for NSW Police said the fire was not being treated as suspicious. The fire comes [after a NSW parliamentary report](/link/follow-20170101-p5lbjl) into electric bikes and scooters made several recommendations to address safety concerns about their use as a mode of transport. The inquiry found they were generally a legitimate method of transport, and recommended electric scooters be legalised and that users – along with e-bike and regular bicycle riders – be allowed to ride on pavements at no more than 15km/h, giving way to pedestrians. Transport for NSW has welcomed the inquiry findings and is considering whether to agree to the recommendations. Other cities, including [Melbourne and Paris](https://www.smh.com.au/link/follow-20170101-p5k4q9), have banned e-scooters. Lithium-ion battery fires are common across NSW, where there were at least 318 in 2024. Last week Fire and Rescue NSW warned of a spike in incidents, after responding to four separate e-bike and e-scooter fires in Sydney within the space of 12 hours. Last year [about 50 people were evacuated](/link/follow-20170101-p5jgmz) from an electric-bike shop in Chippendale due to a fire, with residents reporting hearing “popping” sounds coming from the building as batteries exploded.

Edward Cole, the firm's He","Executives from Man Group, the world's largest publicly traded hedge fund, identify Chinese stocks as a promising investment by 2025. Edward Cole, the firm's Head of Equity Allocation, highlights that China's stock market is poised for a rebound due to expected price bottoms and AI innovations. The decline in U.S. tech stock appeal and China's economic stimuli further support this outlook. Cole emphasizes that Chinese stocks are currently undervalued, and the country's AI innovation potential is underestimated. These factors could make China's stock market one of the best performers in the near future. He predicts that while the U.S. market may face volatility and limited returns, China could emerge as a top-performing market. The rise of Chinese AI startups like DeepSeek has prompted investors to reassess China's technological innovation capabilities. Cole notes that Chinese companies are efficiently innovating with limited resources, often overlooked by capital markets. This innovation drive is seen as a competitive strategy against Western counterparts. Goldman Sachs reports indicate a significant increase in hedge fund investments in Chinese stocks, reaching a four-month high. Cole believes that as investor sentiment improves and funds shift from the U.S., China's stock market could enter a bull phase. Recent stock market rebounds have favored Hong Kong stocks over mainland A-shares, likely due to the former's tech focus. Despite current trends, Cole anticipates a shift with China's policy reforms, especially in housing and social security, potentially sparking a consumer boom that benefits the broader economy.",gurufocus.com,https://www.gurufocus.com/news/2700364/china-stocks-seen-as-top-investment-opportunity-by-2025-says-man-group,"['mngpf', 'ne-ws', 'sar', 'spy']","['Article', 'China', 'ETF', 'Financial Services', 'Gurufocus', 'Gurufocus News', 'News', 'Spy', 'Stock', 'Unknown Sector']",2025-02-14,2025-02-14,4,10,71,160,1642
79593696,"Trump Targets Auto Tariffs, Potential Impact on Mexican Exports","President Trump has announced plans to impose tariffs on automobiles, potentially starting April 2. This follows a series of trade actions since his second term","President Trump has announced plans to impose tariffs on automobiles, potentially starting April 2. This follows a series of trade actions since his second term began, including tariffs on imports from China, Mexico, and Canada. The proposed auto tariffs are part of a broader strategy to reshape global trade and address what Trump sees as unfair treatment of U.S. car exports in foreign markets. Trump's announcement has sparked reactions from the automotive industry. Ford CEO Jim Farley expressed support for reviewing auto imports, emphasizing the importance of comprehensive trade policies. However, the industry remains concerned about the increased costs and confusion resulting from Trump's tariffs. According to Ward’s Intelligence, nearly a quarter of new cars sold in the U.S. last year were classified as imports. The USMCA trade agreement, revised during Trump's first term, sets detailed rules for vehicle parts originating from North America. Analysts suggest Trump's tariff comments may signal the start of renegotiating this agreement, which is up for review in 2026. Market reactions to the tariff threat have been significant, with Hong Kong auto stocks experiencing declines. Huatai Securities notes that the 25% tariff would primarily affect Mexican and Canadian exports. Mexico, a key automotive production hub, exported approximately 221,000 passenger vehicles to the U.S. in 2024.

79593734,"llegal trade, climate change decimates Indian pangolin population in Pakistan",World Wide Fund for Nature-Pakistan calls for urgent steps to save endangered species on eve of World Pangolin Day - Anadolu Ajansı,"[Asia - Pacific](https://www.aa.com.tr/en/asia-pacific) llegal trade, climate change decimates Indian pangolin population in Pakistan World Wide Fund for Nature-Pakistan calls for urgent steps to save endangered species on eve of World Pangolin Day KARACHI, Pakistan The population of the Indian pangolin has drastically plummeted in Pakistan due to a variety of factors, mainly poaching, illegal trade, habitat loss, retaliatory killings and climate change. The Indian pangolin (Manis crassicaudata) is the only pangolin species found in the South Asian country, which is classified as endangered on the red list of the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) with a declining population trend. On the eve of World Pangolin Day, observed on the third Saturday in February, the World Wide Fund for Nature-Pakistan (WWF-Pakistan) called for urgent steps to save the declining population of the endangered species. In Pakistan, particularly in the northeastern Potohar region, the species has disappeared from 80% of its former range, the WWF said Friday in a statement. While exact population estimates are challenging to determine, the overall population has drastically declined. According to the IUCN, other population models predict that the global Indian pangolin population may decrease by approximately 50% in the next 20 years. Karachi, the country's commercial capital, is the hub of illegal trade of the species, according to WWF. Several cases of confiscation of pangolin scales and body parts have been reported in the city. Studies indicate that Pakistan is a transit route for the international smuggling of pangolin scales, primarily to China and Southeast Asia. To save the pangolin population, WWF-Pakistan proposed penalties for poaching and illegal trade should be increased. Conservation efforts Speaking about the significance of the species, Muhammad Jamshed Iqbal Chaudhry, senior manager of research and conservation, WWF-Pakistan, said proposed reforestation projects and protection of pangolin habitats in key regions like the Potohar Plateau, Margalla Hills, and Azad Jammu and Kashmir. ""Scientific studies to assess pangolin population trends and distribution in Pakistan should be conducted,"" he added. Currently, WWF-Pakistan is working on pangolin conservation with “Saving the Pangolin of Pakistan” project being implemented in northwestern Khyber Phaktunkhwa. A Pangolin Protection Zone, enforced with community-based watch and ward, is being established in the southern districts of the same province.

79593698,Beavers saved Czech Republic over $1M on infrastructure project,"Eurasian beavers were once hunted to near extinction but have seen a resurgence in recent decades across the continent, according to National Geographic.","Beavers saved Czech Republic over $1M on infrastructure project Leave it to beavers. Beavers saved the government of the Czech Republic over $1 million on an ill-fated infrastructure project by doing what they do best — building a dam. Officials in the Brdy region of the European country had secured $1.2 million in funding for a new dam that was first planned seven years ago for an area under environmental protection — but the project stalled due to trouble obtaining building permits, [Radio Prague International reported](https://english.radio.cz/beavers-build-planned-dams-protected-landscape-area-while-local-officials-still-8841536). While officials twiddled their thumbs, a colony of eight beavers cut right through the bureaucratic red tape and got to work constructing several dams, creating a natural wetland — exactly what their human cohabitants were trying to achieve. “The Military Forest Management and Vltava River Basin were negotiating with each other to set up the project and address issues regarding ownership of land,” zoologist Jiri Vlček told the outlet. “The beavers beat them to it, saving us CZK 30 million. They built the dams without any project documentation — and for free,” the expert added. The dams popped up seemingly overnight — with local experts suggesting the rodential construction project could have been completed in as few as a couple of days. To boot, the dams were ideally placed for preserving the wetland. “Beavers always know best. The places where they build dams are always chosen just right — better than when we design it on paper,” said Jaroslav Obermajer, head of the Central Bohemian office of the Czech Nature and Landscape Protection Agency. The wetland that was created by the dams will help both the beaver colony and the Czech natives as well as a plethora of other species that will call the biome their home — including insects, fish, amphibians, and birds.

79593703,Blue blood Kansas is making its first trip to the Huntsman Center. What Bill Self said about the Runnin’ Utes,No. 17 Jayhawks come to town to face a Utah team on a two-game losing streak.,"The most anticipated home game for the Utah Runnin’ Utes this season is here. When the scheduling matrix for Utah’s initial Big 12 basketball schedule was [released last June](https://www.deseret.com/sports/2024/06/27/utah-basketball-mens-womens-big-12-opponent-schedule-matrix-2024-25-season/), one matchup in particular stood out — blue blood program Kansas was coming to the Huntsman Center. That was the headliner of a difficult 20-game conference slate, one that also has included home matchups against Texas Tech, Baylor and BYU so far this year. Saturday’s matchup will be the first time the Jayhawks have played at the Huntsman Center. Kansas coach Bill Self believes Utah has adapted “fine” to playing in the Big 12. The Utes currently sit at 13-11 and 5-8 in league action in their first season in the conference. “Looking at their record in league, what are they, 5-8 and 4-2 at home, which is basically kind of where we are, (though) we’ve won a couple more games on the road than what they have,” [Self told Kansas-based reporters this week](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LAiQZhZiNjc). “But for the most part, I think they’ve adapted pretty well and it’ll always take time, with the exception of Houston coming in last year and Arizona this year, to be able to recruit to the league and the competition that you’re playing against.” Kansas sits fifth in the Big 12 standings coming into Saturday’s matchup, with an 8-5 league mark. The Jayhawks are 17-7 overall. Kansas has split its last six games. On Tuesday, the Jayhawks beat Colorado and are looking for their first two-game win streak since mid-January. Self was complimentary of a Utah team — and head coach Craig Smith — that is looking to snap a two-game losing streak. “I think that, obviously, (Smith is) a terrific coach and has been good everywhere he’s been,” Self said. “The way that they play gives them a chance to be in each and every game because they’ve got guys that can shoot it, and a couple that can really shoot in particular, that know each other ridiculously well, that I think that they could give anybody problems.” Utah and Kansas have played just twice before, with the Jayhawks winning both times. The first game was in 1995, and the second in 2014, with both games being played in Kansas City. This isn’t the first time Kansas has played in Salt Lake City. Less than 12 months ago, the Jayhawks played in the Delta Center during last year’s NCAA tournament, beating Samford in the first round before losing to Gonzaga in the second round. Self isn’t worried about the altitude being a factor in the game. “The game’s indoors, so it really shouldn’t affect us. If I’m not mistaken, you guys can look it up, Salt Lake and Provo are right around 4,200 feet, you know, and Boulder (Colorado) is right around 5,200, so the altitude could play a factor,” he said. “But the altitude is not like going to Laramie, Wyoming, either, where you’re playing at 7,000, so that will be something that, to be honest with you, we’ll know about it as a staff, but we’re not going to spend much time talking about it.” Following Saturday’s game, Kansas will stay in Utah and play BYU in Provo on Tuesday. Self said this trip could have the “same potential effect” as a nonconference MTE, something the Jayhawks did not play in this year. “That’s a team bonding trip where you go to Maui or Bahamas or whatever. Well, instead of going to Nassau, we’re going to go to Salt Lake and Provo but, but the reality of is, to me, it has the same potential effect as what a Maui does, or what something else like that does, because this team didn’t get a chance to to do that this year,” Self said. The Jayhawks are led by Hunter Dickinson, the 7-foot-2 grad student center who’s a consensus two-time second-team All-American. He’s averaging 16.6 points and 9.6 rebounds this season, while senior guard Zeke Mayo, a transfer from South Dakota State, is adding 15.0 points per contest. “Kansas is very different. They’re a different type of team than we’ve seen this year,” Smith said. “Obviously, Hunter Dickinson is a guy that, I mean, I’ve never seen him in person, but he looks huge on TV, and he’s really skilled, a really good passer. “They just really complement each other well, they play through the bigs, which doesn’t necessarily happen a ton in the Big 12. They’re a little bit different that way, so it is a different type of prep.” This will be a Quad 1 opportunity for Utah, and Monday’s quick turnaround game against Kansas State, also at the Huntsman Center, is a Quad 2 matchup. So far, the Utes are 0-9 in Quad 1 games. While Smith acknowledged the importance of picking up top-level wins, it’s not a focus among the team. “Quad 1 wins matter, but bad losses matter as well,” said Smith, whose team is 10-0 against Quad 3 and Quad 4 opponents. “We don’t really talk about it. I don’t look at it like that. We’ve just got to go out and put our best foot forward.” “... You’ve got to find ways to win those games, because the margin is just so tight in so many of these games.”",deseret.com,https://www.deseret.com/sports/2025/02/14/utah-basketball-hosts-kansas-advance-huntsman-center/,['hun'],"['-Feed-Local', 'Basic Materials', 'Stock']",2025-02-14,2025-02-14,1,3,109,77,5061

Nonetheless, we'd need to dig a little deeper to determine if there is a rational basis for the highly elevated P/E. For instance, UV Germi's receding earnings in recent times would have to be some food for thought. One possibility is that the P/E is high because investors think the company will still do enough to outperform the broader market in the near future. You'd really hope so, otherwise you're paying a pretty hefty price for no particular reason. [ View our latest analysis for UV Germi ](https://simplywall.st/stocks/fr/capital-goods/epa-aluvi/uv-germi-shares) [free report on UV Germi](https://simplywall.st/stocks/fr/capital-goods/epa-aluvi/uv-germi-shares/past)will help you shine a light on its historical performance. Is There Enough Growth For UV Germi? There's an inherent assumption that a company should far outperform the market for P/E ratios like UV Germi's to be considered reasonable. Retrospectively, the last year delivered a frustrating 40% decrease to the company's bottom line. As a result, earnings from three years ago have also fallen 34% overall. Accordingly, shareholders would have felt downbeat about the medium-term rates of earnings growth. In contrast to the company, the rest of the market is expected to grow by 12% over the next year, which really puts the company's recent medium-term earnings decline into perspective. In light of this, it's alarming that UV Germi's P/E sits above the majority of other companies. It seems most investors are ignoring the recent poor growth rate and are hoping for a turnaround in the company's business prospects. There's a very good chance existing shareholders are setting themselves up for future disappointment if the P/E falls to levels more in line with the recent negative growth rates. The Final Word Generally, our preference is to limit the use of the price-to-earnings ratio to establishing what the market thinks about the overall health of a company. Our examination of UV Germi revealed its shrinking earnings over the medium-term aren't impacting its high P/E anywhere near as much as we would have predicted, given the market is set to grow. When we see earnings heading backwards and underperforming the market forecasts, we suspect the share price is at risk of declining, sending the high P/E lower. Unless the recent medium-term conditions improve markedly, it's very challenging to accept these prices as being reasonable. You need to take note of risks, for example -[ UV Germi has 4 warning signs ](https://simplywall.st/stocks/fr/capital-goods/epa-aluvi/uv-germi-shares) (and 1 which shouldn't be ignored) we think you should know about.

Can it break $24, or will the rally fade?","Trump’s meme coin, TRUMP, just experienced a wild 40% surge before settling at $21, bringing it back into the spotlight after weeks of decline. The token had crashed hard from $73 to under $15, but it looks like traders are jumping back in. This week, its daily trading volume jumped past $5.5 billion, a huge leap from less than $1 billion earlier this week. The rally isn’t happening in isolation. The broader crypto market is heating up, with meme coins and altcoins making big moves. XRP is up 13%, now trading at $2.79, while Dogecoin, the original meme coin, has climbed 8%, nearing $0.28. Even Bitcoin, which has been moving slower compared to these, has inched up 2%. So, what’s causing this sudden rush? Part of it is pure hype, meme coins tend to move in waves, and when momentum kicks in, traders pile on quickly. TRUMP’s name recognition and past volatility make it a prime candidate for speculative bets. The huge spike in volume suggests traders are revisiting risky plays, hoping to catch another rally before the market cools off again.

But as Peter Lynch said in One Up On Wall Street, 'Long shots almost never pay off.' A loss-making company is yet to prove itself with profit, and eventually the inflow of external capital may dry up. If this kind of company isn't your style, you like companies that generate revenue, and even earn profits, then you may well be interested in Excellence ([WSE:EXC](https://simplywall.st/stocks/pl/food-beverage-tobacco/wse-exc/excellence-shares)). While this doesn't necessarily speak to whether it's undervalued, the profitability of the business is enough to warrant some appreciation - especially if its growing. [ Check out our latest analysis for Excellence ](https://simplywall.st/stocks/pl/food-beverage-tobacco/wse-exc/excellence-shares) How Quickly Is Excellence Increasing Earnings Per Share? The market is a voting machine in the short term, but a weighing machine in the long term, so you'd expect share price to follow earnings per share (EPS) outcomes eventually. That makes EPS growth an attractive quality for any company. Excellence's shareholders have have plenty to be happy about as their annual EPS growth for the last 3 years was 45%. That sort of growth rarely ever lasts long, but it is well worth paying attention to when it happens. Top-line growth is a great indicator that growth is sustainable, and combined with a high earnings before interest and taxation (EBIT) margin, it's a great way for a company to maintain a competitive advantage in the market. Unfortunately, Excellence's revenue dropped 6.4% last year, but the silver lining is that EBIT margins improved from 5.0% to 16%. That falls short of ideal. You can take a look at the company's revenue and earnings growth trend, in the chart below. To see the actual numbers, click on the chart. Since Excellence is no giant, with a market capitalisation of zł35m, you should [definitely check its cash and debt](https://simplywall.st/stocks/pl/food-beverage-tobacco/wse-exc/excellence-shares/health) before getting too excited about its prospects. Are Excellence Insiders Aligned With All Shareholders? Theory would suggest that it's an encouraging sign to see high insider ownership of a company, since it ties company performance directly to the financial success of its management. So as you can imagine, the fact that Excellence insiders own a significant number of shares certainly is appealing. Indeed, with a collective holding of 53%, company insiders are in control and have plenty of capital behind the venture. Intuition will tell you this is a good sign because it suggests they will be incentivised to build value for shareholders over the long term. Of course, Excellence is a very small company, with a market cap of only zł35m. So despite a large proportional holding, insiders only have zł19m worth of stock. This isn't an overly large holding but it should still keep the insiders motivated to deliver the best outcomes for shareholders. Does Excellence Deserve A Spot On Your Watchlist? Excellence's earnings per share have been soaring, with growth rates sky high. This level of EPS growth does wonders for attracting investment, and the large insider investment in the company is just the cherry on top. At times fast EPS growth is a sign the business has reached an inflection point, so there's a potential opportunity to be had here. So at the surface level, Excellence is worth putting on your watchlist; after all, shareholders do well when the market underestimates fast growing companies. We should say that we've discovered [1 warning sign for Excellence](https://simplywall.st/stocks/pl/food-beverage-tobacco/wse-exc/excellence-shares) that you should be aware of before investing here. Although Excellence certainly looks good, it may appeal to more investors if insiders were buying up shares. If you like to see companies with more skin in the game, then check out this [handpicked selection of Polish companies that not only boast of strong growth but have strong insider backing](https://simplywall.st/discover/investing-ideas/10228/fast-growing-stocks-with-high-insider-ownership).

These range from £0 for 100MB to £22 for unlimited data, with the plans lasting for 12 months.

79593632,The incredible 500m landmark set to be 'the UK's tower of Pisa',The famous landmark leans slightly to the northwest but the tilt is not considered dangerous and is unlikely to cause problems for a while.,"The incredible £500m landmark set to be 'the UK's tower of Pisa' The famous landmark leans slightly to the northwest but the tilt is not considered dangerous and is unlikely to cause problems for a while. [The UK](/news/uk) is home to many [famous landmarks](/travel/articles/1729736/uk-best-landmark-london-eye-stonehenge-full-list), but few are as iconic as its world-famous clock tower. While it may seem perfectly upright, experts have discovered that it has a slight tilt - one that, over time, could rival one of [Europe's](/latest/europe) most famous leaning structures. If left unchecked, the landmark could lean as much as the [Tower of Pisa](/latest/italy) in roughly 4,000 years. That landmark is, of course, [Big Ben](/latest/london), officially known as the [Elizabeth Tower](/latest/london), which has stood at the [Palace of Westminster](/latest/westminster) since 1859. Over the years, shifting ground conditions and the construction of [London’s Jubilee Line](/latest/london-underground) beneath the building have caused the tower to develop a 0.26-degree tilt. That may not seem like much, but it is a 16th of the Leaning Tower of Pisa’s famous tilt. As far as the value of the tower is concerned, estimates suggest that if it were ever put up for sale, it could be worth £500million or more, given its historic and cultural value. Just the recent restoration work alone, completed in 2022, cost around £80million. The four-year project involved repairing the iron framework, replacing damaged limestone, and reinforcing the tower's structural integrity. Engineers even had to develop a new crash system under the tower to protect it from potential structural failures. Don't miss...

Engineers believe the movement is slow and will not pose any danger for thousands of years. However, the tilt adds another layer to the history of Big Ben, which has already survived bomb damage during World War 2, a major crack in its famous bell, and centuries of London’s unpredictable weather. Nicknamed after Sir Benjamin Hall, the official who oversaw its installation, Big Ben remains one of the most recognisable landmarks in the world. It has four giant clock faces, each measuring 22.5 feet in diameter, and is topped by a 13.5-ton Great Bell. Despite modern technology, Big Ben still uses its original 19th-century clock mechanism and is adjusted by adding or removing pre-decimal pennies from its pendulum.",express.co.uk,https://www.express.co.uk/news/uk/2013118/uk-landmark-tower-of-pisa-big-ben-london,[],"['500 Million Landmark', 'Big Ben', 'Big Ben Is Leaning', 'Big Ben Tilt', 'Elizabeth Tower', 'Leaning Tower Of Pisa']",2025-02-14,2025-02-14,0,6,63,139,2888

""Would you rather watch your parents have sex every day for the rest of your life or join in once and stop it forever?"" Mr Allahbadia had asked a contestant. After the backlash, he offered an apology and blamed a lapse in judgement.

We believe quality journalism should be available to everyone, paid for by those who can afford it. Your support makes all the difference.[Republican](/topic/republican) senator [Lisa Murkowski](/topic/lisa-murkowski) has introduced legislation that would formally rename [North America](/topic/north-america)’s tallest peak as Denali — defying [President Donald Trump’s recent executive order](/news/world/americas/us-politics/trump-executive-orders-tariffs-federal-musk-live-news-b2698501.html) to call it Mount McKinley. The Alaska mountain was named Mount McKinley in 1896 – the year William McKinley became the nation’s 25th president – even though he had never even visited the state. It was changed to Denali during the Obama administration in 2015 “in recognition of the traditions of Alaska Natives and the strong support of the people of Alaska.” Murkowski’s bill is backed by fellow Alaskan Republican senator [Dan Sullivan](/topic/dan-sullivan), hit back. “In Alaska, it’s Denali,” Murkowski said in a [statement](https://www.murkowski.senate.gov/press/release/murkowski-its-denali). The bill requires the mountain be referred to as Denali in maps, documents, and other U.S. records. “Alaskans from every walk of life have long been advocating for this mountain to be recognized by its true name,” Murkowski said, adding that it was not “a political issue.” On his first day in office last month, Trump said the decision to recognize the peak as Denali instead of Mount McKinley was “an affront to President McKinley’s life, his achievements and his sacrifice.” Murkowski, who voted against confirming Pete Hegseth as defense secretary last month, said that she has long advocated for the mountain to officially be called Denali. Alaska had a longstanding request for the mountain to be renamed Denali from McKinley, but had faced opposition from Ohio lawmakers for years. Murkowski and Sullivan earlier in 2015 introduced legislation calling for the mountain to be designated Denali. During Trump's first term, the senators pushed back when Trump brought up the idea of having the peak's name revert to Mount McKinley. Earlier this month, the Alaska Legislature passed a resolution urging the Trump administration to reverse course and keep the name Denali. It’s not the first time Murkowski has gone against the president during his second term.

While the wisdom is not to skimp on key pieces such as sofas, dining tables and [beds](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/recommended/sleep/best-mattress/), there are times when we crave newness; a quick pick-me-up that will freshen up the [kitchen table](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/interiors/home/round-table-perfect-for-small-kitchen/) or the living room without costing a fortune. That’s why H&M Home’s decor pieces have become something of a secret weapon among homeware fans. The lead members of its design team migrated over to homeware from fashion, which explains the directional nature of many of the pieces. They are designed in-house at the H&M’s Stockholm HQ, so the brand has been able to develop its own distinctive aesthetic: modern and minimalist, but with a cool twist. Statement looks in calming colours While budget homeware lines often have a comparatively basic look, here there is a focus on the details that elevate the overall effect – for example, the sculptural forms of the stoneware vases, or the textured floral motif on a cushion cover.",telegraph.co.uk,https://www.telegraph.co.uk/interiors/home/hm-homes-new-collection-is-quiet-luxury-on-a-budget/,[],"['H&M', 'Interiors', 'Lifestyle', 'Standard', 'Tiingo Top', 'Us Content']",2025-02-14,2025-02-14,0,6,88,97,1572
79593735,Over 70 US civil rights groups urge Trump to abandon Gaza occupation plan,"'Gaza is not a ‘big real estate site’ that can go to the highest bidder,' groups write in letter - Anadolu Ajansı","[Americas](https://www.aa.com.tr/en/americas), [Middle East](https://www.aa.com.tr/en/middle-east) Over 70 US civil rights groups urge Trump to abandon Gaza occupation plan 'Gaza is not a ‘big real estate site’ that can go to the highest bidder,' groups write in letter WASHINGTON More than 70 national and local civil rights, faith-based organizations and advocacy groups urged President Donald Trump to abandon his proposal to “take over” the Gaza Strip and forcibly relocate its Palestinian population. In a letter sent to the president on Thursday, signatories expressed ""deep concern"" over Trump’s recent proposals advocating for the expulsion of nearly 2 million Palestinians from their homeland. They urged the administration to instead build on previous diplomatic efforts that led to a ceasefire in Gaza rather than pursuing policies that could destabilize the region. ""Put simply, the ethnic cleansing and U.S. occupation of Gaza would spark a massive backlash in the Arab and Muslim world, drain American resources by entangling the U.S. military in new forever wars, and make the peaceful establishment of a Palestinian state impossible, leading to even more conflict in the region,"" they wrote in the letter, which was shared publicly on Friday. They also warned that Trump's plan would undermine the progress he has made when he helped secure the ceasefire deal, which came into effect Jan.19, pausing Israel’s 15-month military assault that has killed more than 48,200 people, mostly women and children, and left the enclave in ruins. Among the signatories were the Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR), American Muslims for Palestine (AMP), CODEPINK, Peace Action and the US Council of Muslim Organizations (USCMO), along with numerous organizations and advocacy groups. “Gaza is not a ‘big real estate site’ that can go to the highest bidder,” the letter stated. “It is a land that millions of Palestinians have called home for generations.” The letter urged Trump to work with regional partners to rebuild Gaza without displacing its residents. ""We urge your administration to abandon the expulsion and occupation proposal. You should instead work with the Arab and Muslim world to develop a realistic proposal to rebuild Gaza without expelling Palestinians from their ancestral homes,"" they said. The letter also outlined a broader peace agenda with key goals, including a call for a permanent ceasefire, humanitarian rebuilding of Gaza, an international redevelopment fund for Palestinian statehood, full US recognition of a Palestinian state and an end to Israel’s occupation and discriminatory policies. Trump said at a news conference with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu last week that the US would “take over” Gaza and resettle Palestinians elsewhere under an extraordinary redevelopment plan that he claimed could turn the enclave into “the Riviera of the Middle East.” His proposal was met with widespread condemnations from Palestinians, Muslim and Arab countries, and many other nations across the world. Israel has maintained a blockade on Gaza for years, effectively turning it into the world’s largest open-air prison. According to the UN, nearly 2 million of the million residents in Gaza have been displaced since the start of the war after an attack by the Palestinian group, Hamas, on Oct. 7, 2023. The population in Gaza faces dire shortages of food, water and medicine.

To decide if this trend could continue, we decided to look at its weak fundamentals as they shape the long-term market trends. Specifically, we decided to study [Hydraulic Elements and Systems AD's ](https://simplywall.st/stocks/bg/capital-goods/bul-hes/hydraulic-elements-and-systems-ad-shares) ROE in this article. Return on equity or ROE is an important factor to be considered by a shareholder because it tells them how effectively their capital is being reinvested. Simply put, it is used to assess the profitability of a company in relation to its equity capital. [ See our latest analysis for Hydraulic Elements and Systems AD ](https://simplywall.st/stocks/bg/capital-goods/bul-hes/hydraulic-elements-and-systems-ad-shares) How Is ROE Calculated? The formula for ROE is: Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' Equity So, based on the above formula, the ROE for Hydraulic Elements and Systems AD is: 7.5% = лв3.6m ÷ лв48m (Based on the trailing twelve months to September 2024). The 'return' is the income the business earned over the last year. That means that for every BGN1 worth of shareholders' equity, the company generated BGN0.07 in profit. What Is The Relationship Between ROE And Earnings Growth? We have already established that ROE serves as an efficient profit-generating gauge for a company's future earnings. Based on how much of its profits the company chooses to reinvest or ""retain"", we are then able to evaluate a company's future ability to generate profits. Generally speaking, other things being equal, firms with a high return on equity and profit retention, have a higher growth rate than firms that don’t share these attributes. A Side By Side comparison of Hydraulic Elements and Systems AD's Earnings Growth And 7.5% ROE At first glance, Hydraulic Elements and Systems AD's ROE doesn't look very promising. A quick further study shows that the company's ROE doesn't compare favorably to the industry average of 11% either. Hence, the flat earnings seen by Hydraulic Elements and Systems AD over the past five years could probably be the result of it having a lower ROE. As a next step, we compared Hydraulic Elements and Systems AD's net income growth with the industry and discovered that the industry saw an average growth of 14% in the same period. Earnings growth is a huge factor in stock valuation. The investor should try to establish if the expected growth or decline in earnings, whichever the case may be, is priced in. Doing so will help them establish if the stock's future looks promising or ominous. Is Hydraulic Elements and Systems AD fairly valued compared to other companies? These [3 valuation measures](https://simplywall.st/stocks/bg/capital-goods/bul-hes/hydraulic-elements-and-systems-ad-shares/valuation) might help you decide. Is Hydraulic Elements and Systems AD Using Its Retained Earnings Effectively? Hydraulic Elements and Systems AD has a high three-year median payout ratio of 92% (or a retention ratio of 7.6%), meaning that the company is paying most of its profits as dividends to its shareholders. This does go some way in explaining why there's been no growth in its earnings. Moreover, Hydraulic Elements and Systems AD has been paying dividends for at least ten years or more suggesting that management must have perceived that the shareholders prefer dividends over earnings growth. Summary Overall, we would be extremely cautious before making any decision on Hydraulic Elements and Systems AD. Specifically, it has shown quite an unsatisfactory performance as far as earnings growth is concerned, and a poor ROE and an equally poor rate of reinvestment seem to be the reason behind this inadequate performance. So far, we've only made a quick discussion around the company's earnings growth.

Last [Christmas](/latest/christmas) I didn't give you my heart but shortly before the big day I did struggle to stand up while waiting for the doors of a circus show to open. When I say ""struggle"" I mean I was close to explaining to one of the event managers that I have [cancer](/latest/cancer?pageNumber=70) and need to find a seat before I collapse. Eventually the doors opened and, fuelled by overpriced lemonade, I was fine. But it has left me wondering about the summer. I'm in the part of life where I'm too old for [Glastonbury Festival](/latest/glastonbury-festival) but in my pre-cancer days still loved sitting in a field or park with a paper cup full of lager watching bands. Back in 2023 I'd just started chemotherapy and thought I was too ill to be at a festival. Last summer I felt the same. I was still on a chemotherapy drug called oxaliplatin, so was wiped out for a lot of the time. This year I'm thinking that if chemotherapy is going to continue until I die then maybe I need to start living. That's one thing we risk forgetting when talking about a deadly disease. If you're reading this then you need to start living for today too. Book the holiday you've always wanted to go on. Meet up with the friend you haven't seen for a decade. Get up close and personal with your favourite band by sorting the tickets and cling on to the barrier for dear life. But - back to me. I need to start living by working out if I could stand up for five-and-a-half hours. I'd really like to see Charlotte de Witte do her DJ thing and I've found out she's playing at the Junction 2 festival in London at the end of July. (It's one of those city ones where instead of it being what I'd call a proper festival, it's thousands of people in a park but it's better than nothing.) Last entry to the event is at 5ish so they can make their money on lager and supposedly gourmet burgers, which you've just seen them get out of the freezer and look no different to very budget ones, and I doubt she'd be on much before 10pm. This means I'd have to entertain myself while being worried about chemo side-effects and, if it is rainy and muddy, not knowing where I would be able to sit down. The other big issue at the moment is that I don't have anyone to go with and I'm not good at doing things on my own. I wonder if I'd just book myself a ticket and go for it if I didn't have cancer. I'd like to think I would but, for me, my perspective about everything has changed, even though I still like to think I'm the same person I was before I was diagnosed with my incurable disease. This is why the Daily Express Cancer Care campaign is so important. There are millions of cancer patients out there just trying to do the best we can to be us instead of being defined by cancer. Not everyone will want to come and see Charlotte de Witte with me (get in touch if you do) but everyone may experience wellbeing issues along their ""cancer journey"". The best way to tackle this is to ensure medical teams help them with any mental health problems that arise both during and after treatment. Even if it's just a small worry about standing up for five hours because not everyone has the luxury of a weekly Daily Express comment piece to express how they are feeling.",express.co.uk,https://www.express.co.uk/news/uk/2014645/cancer-patients-morbid-talk,[],"['Cancer', 'Daily Express Cancer Care']",2025-02-14,2025-02-14,0,2,79,159,3491
79593592,Church of England faces existential crisis after sex abuse scandal revelations,"In a world where trust is paramount, the Church of England faces a crisis that could redefine its very existence.","Church of England faces existential crisis after sex abuse scandal revelations In a world where trust is paramount, the Church of England faces a crisis that could redefine its very existence. The Church of England is facing a day of reckoning over historic sex abuse allegations that have shattered trust in its leadership. It once stood as a beacon of hope to those who were lost, lonely and in need, but could 2025 be the nadir of its 1,500 year existence? This week has seen days of tense meetings at the general synod - effectively its internal parliament - as bitter recriminations over its catastrophic failures in protecting children dominated discussions. It is the first time senior figures have gathered since Archbishop of Canterbury Justin Welby was forced to quit in disgrace. The principal leader of the Church of England resigned after an independent probe exposed a cover up surrounding barrister, Christian camp leader and serial abuser John Smyth QC. It concluded he might have been brought to justice had Mr Welby bothered to come forward to police before the abuser met his maker. Mr Welby formally stepped down last month, but his departure unleashed civil war in the church he once led as clergy face shame over failure to safeguard its flock. One fifth of members of the synod do not want liberal moderniser The Most Rev Stephen Cottrell to replace him. The Archbishop of York has been the Church of England's de facto temporary leader but has himself faced calls to resign. He has come under increasing pressure, accused of not acting quickly enough in his then-role as Bishop of Chelmsford, over priest David Tudor, who was allowed to remain in post despite having been barred by the church from being alone with children and paying compensation to a sexual abuse victim. This week the church parliament voted overwhelmingly in favour of an overhaul of a process to discipline clergy - five years after first concluding the current system was “overly legalistic, slow, and burdensome”. The new system includes investigations into serious misconduct cases overseen by a professional team of investigators and lawyers, while bishops will have statutory duties to ensure support for all those affected by a complaint. Mr Cottrell welcomed the new move, saying: ""This structure will enable appropriate scrutiny to be given to complaints. It allows accountability and more transparency around these processes."" Yet it is likely to do little to quell disquiet and calm turmoil swirling in the Church of England after the damning Makin Review into how it covered up prolific abuse by Smyth. It found he attacked as many as 130 boys and young men. Smyth died aged 75 in Cape Town in 2018 while still under investigation. Authorities may have been able to bring him to justice had Mr Welby reported the abuse after he became archbishop in 2013, the review found. In a statement the ousted archbishop said he was ""deeply sorry that this abuse happened"" and ""sorry that concealment by many people who were fully aware of the abuse over many years meant that Smyth was able to abuse overseas and died before he ever faced justice"". He added: ""I had no idea or suspicion of this abuse before 2013. Nevertheless, the review is clear that I personally failed to ensure that after disclosure in 2013 the awful tragedy was energetically investigated."" Installed in 2013 after a career as an oil exploration executive he once described the church he led as “one of the most powerful forces of social cohesion”. Yet he openly played politics, pitting the church against the public with a series of damaging interventions, mostly notably a withering denunciation of the Tory scheme to stop migrant small boat crossings by sending asylum seekers on a one-way flight to Rwanda, arguing it was ""morally unacceptable"" and ""leading the nation down a damaging path"". That outburst came less than two years after Iraqi-born Emad al-Swealmeen planned to detonate a homemade bomb at Liverpool Women's Hospital in retribution for a failed asylum claim having attempted to dupe the authorities into staying here by befriending churchgoers and halfheartedly converting to Christianity. Some have been appalled by Mr Welby’s frequent interventions and apparent wokeness, apologising for the role of the church in the “evil” slave trade which last year saw it pledge to turn a £100m financial commitment into a £1bn fund to cleanse itself of “moral sin”. And many were permanently put off by apparent contradictions, like a liberal touch on issues including migration, and progressive stance on sexuality. Lay preacher Smyth is thought to be the most prolific serial abuser to be associated with the Church of England. In November Mr Welby apologised, saying the abuser had ""manipulated Christian truth to justify his evil acts”. But it was another two months until he formally resigned. It suggested The Holy Spirit took some time to fully emerge. And not for the first time. Mr Cottrell, who has taken over most of Mr Welby’s responsibilities, has so far resisted calls to quit, saying he would “do what I can” to bring about independent scrutiny of safeguarding in the Church. But is he really the man to lead it away from the crisis? Rt Revd Dr Helen-Ann Hartley, the Bishop of Newcastle, doesn’t think so and said: “I do not think that it’s appropriate for the Archbishop of York to be in post, and certainly to be leading change that the Church needs at this time. “I think he (Mr Cottrell) is the wrong person. I think to be in that position of leadership, you have to talk the talk and walk the walk, and you can’t have one without the other. And I think for him to have allowed that to be the case, to allow Tudor to remain in post, I do find it abhorrent.” With the church in existential crisis, talk now turns to Mr Welby’s successor and the need to balance the thinking of a modern world with unity, most notably over proposed changes to sexual ethics which has led to the introduction of same-sex blessings in church and might in due course allow same-sex civil marriages for the clergy. It is certainly true there have been crises before. When has the church not been in crisis? For years it has faced dwindling and ageing congregations - around 700,000 people now attend the Church of England each week compared to 850,000 in 2019 - as it battles for relevance in an increasingly secular society. And only a decade ago Peter Ball, Bishop of Lewes between 1977 and 1992 and Bishop of Gloucester from 1992, was jailed after pleading guilty to a string of sex offences on teenagers and young men. A report by the Independent Inquiry into Child Sexual Abuse said he was an example of how a senior member of the Anglican church ""was able to sexually abuse vulnerable teenagers and young men for decades"". It accused the Church of England of ""putting its own reputation above the needs of victims"" and offering secrecy and protection for abusers that allowed them to ""hide in plain sight"". Ball had been friends with King Charles, then Prince of Wales, before he was convicted. In a written submission to the inquiry, the now King said he felt ""deep personal regret"" for trusting Ball when initial reports of abuse emerged, years before he was jailed. He died in 2019, a year after Smyth. The blame for the current mess rests with a collective and historic failure to listen to survivors of abuse magnifying a lack of transparency, accountability and trust. How the Church of England begins to recover from the fallout, and if it can, remains to be seen. But when people look to an organisation and believe it is something they can no longer trust, history tells us there is seldom any hope of restoring it.",express.co.uk,https://www.express.co.uk/news/uk/2014173/church-england-archbishop-york-canterbury,[],"['Archbishop Of Canterbury', 'Church Of England', 'Justin Welby', 'King Charles']",2025-02-14,2025-02-14,0,4,78,113,7708

England snatched a last-gasp 26-25 victory over France at the weekend in their Six Nations clash, with 22-year-old fly-half Smith playing a starring role. And his performance has drawn comparisons from Lawes with England's 2003 World Cup hero Wilkinson. In a recent column for The Times, Lawes wrote: “He’s got the tactical mind that an international No.10 needs. I don’t see any reason that he can’t be as good as Jonny Wilkinson was in his prime. Smith had looked nervous in the opening minutes against France but became more confident as the game went on. “When the game was on the line and at its most tense, in that final 20 minutes, he looked so comfortable with being in charge. He took on the goal-kicking duties and it didn’t faze him. It was great to see.” Lawes explained how he had been impressed with Smith's rise since his move to Northampton Saints and the youngster's efforts in their charge to the Premiership title and Champions Cup semi-finals last season. He added: ""Fin is inexperienced, but he seems really experienced. That’s just his mindset and the way he carries himself. He probably understands the game better than I do.” Lawes also suggested Smith's ability will only reap further rewards for England by boosting some of his team-mates. “He’s going to be such a good player for England because he brings out the strengths in those around him,"" Lawes said. ""You saw how well he linked with Tommy Freeman and Ollie Sleightholme, the two Saints wings. Smith could help Ollie Lawrence, the Bath centre, take his game to the next level too.” Smith will be confident of earning another start for England in their next Six Nations fixture, when they take on Scotland for the Calcutta Cup on February 22. Scotland have won all of the last four meetings between the sides, with both teams currently on one win apiece in this year's Six Nations, having each lost to Ireland. Smith might not be the only English youngster looking to make his mark, as Steve Borthwick has called up 20-year-old Henry Pollock for a three-day training camp while Tom Curry follows a strict recovery schedule after he had surgery on his hip last year.

Fans are gearing up for the landmark F1 75 Live event at The O2 on Tuesday, and [Lewis Hamilton](/latest/lewis-hamilton) will be expecting a much smoother reception than he received the last time the series visited London. In 2017, new owners Liberty Media organised an unprecedented new event, F1 Live London. The show welcomed a number of music acts and entertainment and saw F1 cars hit the streets around Trafalgar Square, giving British fans in the capital the chance to see their heroes up close and personal. Unfortunately for F1, the sport’s biggest star was absent. The event was held on the Wednesday before the British Grand Prix and attracted a bumper crowd of over 100,000 motorsport enthusiasts. 19 drivers were present in Trafalgar Square, but Hamilton was nowhere to be seen. Instead, the future seven-time world champion jetted off to Greece for a short two-day holiday. The break gave Hamilton the chance to relax and unwind in the midst of a tense title fight with [Ferrari](https://www.express.co.uk/latest/ferrari)’s Sebastian Vettel, but the fans were not impressed. The Brit’s name was booed by the crowd in London. Explaining his decision ahead of his home race that weekend, Hamilton said: “Everyone had the right to make the decision for themselves. I felt it’s been a pretty intense season so far and I felt it’s the best way to prepare.

79593606,I just tried the walking yoga trend for the first time — and here’s what happened to my body,What is walking yoga and should we be trying it?,"Another day, another workout trend. Walking yoga is one of the latest to take off, but what is it, and should we be doing it? I’m no stranger to fusion fitness — the blending of several fitness disciplines into one method — but I wanted to know if, as a keen yogi myself, I should be taking more notice of walking yoga. If you’re also new to the walking yoga trend, let me fill you in on what it means. This is a low-impact workout combining slow-paced, nourishing yoga movement with walking and breathwork. So far, so good. But without context, all I can think about is attempting a downward dog in the middle of my dog walk, and I’m pretty sure there’s more to it than that. To learn more and delve into the walking yoga world myself, I recruited the help of Sophia Drozd, yoga instructor and creator of Y4P — the Yoga 4 Pain app — and this is what she told Tom's Guide. What is walking yoga? “Walking yoga is a practice that combines yoga and breathwork with walking,” Drozd explains. “It's a simple mix of the physical benefits of walking and the calm focus of yoga.” You’ve probably already heard about walking meditation, which involves taking a walk while using breathing techniques or mantras. Walking yoga builds on this by adding yoga poses while walking. Mentally, at this stage, I’m back with the downward dog mid-walk through South West London. Drozd adds: “It also helps you notice the world around you and feel more in tune with your body as you move.” There’s definitely more space for low-impact exercise over beating your body in the gym seven days a week, and Drozd seems to think this is being tapped into with the walking yoga concept. “I think people now know more about their health and taking breaks,” she says. “They step away from screens and take time to focus on themselves. Walking yoga is a great way to do this. Before, walks were often just for a purpose — walking the dog, getting steps in, or having a meeting while walking. These are good for steps, heart health and blood flow. But now, more people are looking for ways to be present and aware.” Is yoga and walking a good combination? At least, according to Drozd, it is. “Walking yoga, at the very least, encourages you to pay attention to your surroundings, your senses, how the walk feels in your body and to synchronize your breathing,” she explains. “It helps you walk mindfully, enjoying the little things… additionally, you can advance your practice by adding in some yoga poses that help your body stay flexible and ease any tension.” Drozd also offers a tip for accessing the benefits of walking yoga by advising to “start small” with short walks or familiar routes to help you settle into your breath without overthinking your route or location. Armed with this knowledge, I plucked a few moves from the walking yoga workout below and headed off to try it myself. The Walking Yoga Workout | FIT 20 | Strengthening + Toning | Yogalates with Rashmi - YouTube I recently heard Bear Grylls on The High Performance Podcast talking about the importance of walking barefoot in nature and how he implements this every day (even if just for 10 minutes), usually on dog walks. This got me thinking about how disconnected I’ve become from nature daily. Could walking yoga be the solution? I don’t know about you, but performing yoga poses outdoors appeals to me far more during the blooming spring, glowing summer, or cozy autumn months — not the depths of winter bundled up in multiple waterproof layers. That said, there’s much to be said about connecting with nature more often. One study published in Science Direct found it can boost creativity levels and improve mood. You don’t have to use yoga poses, though; you can just walk and breathe. Admittedly, I felt a little self-conscious about the whole thing, but I’d like to revisit walking yoga in the warmer months and try it barefoot like Bear. I'm pretty sure the dog walkers I bump into on my morning walks would also prefer it if I didn't greet them from a child's pose. It felt good to be off my phone Physically, Drozd says the benefits of walking yoga can include building stronger muscles, weight management, better cardiovascular health, increased flexibility and mobility and reducing pain and stiffness. But mentally, she credits the practice with reducing stress, improving concentration, enhancing mindfulness and lowering anxiety. One thing I enjoyed about this challenge was getting space away from technology to focus on my breath. I’m still quite bad at practicing this, so I use some breathing exercises for beginners when I need them. Unfortunately, I’m a terrible phone scroller. Admittedly, I felt calmer after an hour of walking, breathwork and a few yoga poses thrown in. It felt good to stretch out my hips and shoulders and reconnect with the outdoors, which Drozd says allows “greater awareness of how you’re moving and how it feels.” I tried to synchronize breathing with steps using a yoga breathing technique I recently learned: start by inhaling for 1, then exhaling for 2, inhaling for 2, then exhaling for 3 and so on. During this time, I couldn’t focus on the past or future, just the present moment. This heightened my senses of what I could see, smell and hear. You don’t need to be a yogi to try it You don’t need to bend into gravity-defying shapes with your body to enjoy walking yoga. “If you’re more of a walker than a yogi, it's going to improve your breathing and help create space in the mind,” Drozd says. “If you’re more of a yogi than a walker, it's a nice alternative to getting off the mat.” Win-win. Breathwork also strengthens the diaphragm — a major respiratory muscle and part of your core. A strong core is responsible for posture and safe movement, among other things. I prefer keeping my walks and yoga separate I have a dynamic yoga practice, so keeping these modalities separate benefits me more. But there’s nothing wrong with trying something different and learning what you like and don’t like. Drozd recommends walking yoga with care if you get motion sickness or vertigo, as this may not be the best option for you. I tried walking yoga for the first time — here’s my verdict With my coaching hat on, I think walking yoga could potentially be a great way for those facing chronic pain to access yoga and gentle movement. Without my coaching hat, I’m not converted — yet. I love bedding down on one of the best yoga mats in a hot yoga studio and gliding through pose after pose as I inhale and exhale. It’s how I find my weekly dose of yogi zen. Walking yoga didn’t quite hit the spot for me, and I found it a bit jarring stopping my walk to perform yoga poses. However, I still enjoy mindful walking and focusing more on my breath. I plan to revisit the challenge in the warmer months as spring approaches. The idea of stretching out into a downward dog in a sun-dappled field appeals to me. When it's warm and I take walks more for leisure than function, I'm far more likely to stop during walks. This could be a great time to throw in some extra yoga poses, and I intend to. Sam Hopes is a level 3 qualified trainer, level 2 reiki practitioner and senior fitness writer at Tom's Guide.

Uncover expert takes and answers in our crossword blog.,"Crossword Puzzles Off the Grid: Sally breaks down USA TODAY's daily crossword puzzle, Got Up [Sally Hoelscher](/staff/72840462007/sally-hoelscher/) USA TODAY There are spoilers ahead. You might want to solve [today's puzzle](https://puzzles.usatoday.com/) before reading further! [Got Up](https://puzzles.usatoday.com/) Constructor: Stella Zawistowski Editor: Anna Gundlach What I Learned from Today’s Puzzle - IKAT (16A: Southeast Asian dyeing technique) IKAT is a dyeing technique that involves dyeing the yarn before it is woven into fabric. The yarn is tightly bound in the desired pattern before being dyed. This process may be repeated to add different colors. The dyed yarns are then woven together. This is in contrast to methods such as tie-dye or batik ( [I have written about batik previously](/story/entertainment/puzzles/crosswords/sally-hoelscher/2024/08/01/daily-crossword-analysis/74593561007/)) in which the fabric is dyed after it is woven. IKAT fabrics have a characteristic blurriness to the design, due to the difficulty of lining up the yarn during the weaving process. - EAR (8D: Place for an industrial piercing) An industrial piercing is an EAR piercing that consists of two piercings connected by a single piece of jewelry. These piercings are often done in the upper EAR cartilage. I have seen industrial piercings before, but I didn't know what they were called. - GOTHAM KNIGHTS (18D: RPG based on the Batman franchise) The GOTHAM KNIGHTS role-playing game (RPG) is a video game that is inspired – as one might guess from its name – by the Batman: GOTHAM KNIGHTS comic book series by DC Comics. In the game, which is set in GOTHAM City, the playable characters Nightwing, Batgirl, Robin, and Red Hood are trying to restore justice to GOTHAM City after the deaths of Batman and Police Commissioner James Gordon. Random Thoughts & Interesting Things - CPK (10A: _alifornia _izza _itchen) California Pizza Kitchen, or CPK, is a restaurant specializing in California-style pizza, which has a thin crust and uses California cuisine-inspired toppings. Although CPK started in California, as its name suggests, it now has locations in 32 U.S. states and 10 countries. Although they do not have any locations in Iowa, I have eaten at a CPK in Las Vegas, Nevada. - CARDS (26A: There are 48 in a pinochle deck) I have never played pinochle, but I know it's a CARD game, so this answer was inferable. Pinochle is a trick-taking game for two to four players. Its 48-CARD deck is comprised of eight CARDS each of ace, ten, king, queen, jack, and nine (this is their ranking order high to low). - ACES (31A: Vegas WNBA squad) and SKY (9D: Chicago WNBA squad) We have a nice pair of WNBA teams represented in the grid. The Las Vegas ACES were WNBA champions in 2022 and 2023. The Chicago SKY were WNBA champions in 2021. - RUTH (40A: Barbie doll creator Handler) The Barbie doll was named after RUTH Handler's daughter. Since the doll's introduction in 1959, over a billion Barbie dolls have been sold. I imagine some people learned the name of RUTH Handler from the 2023 movie Barbie. Rhea Perlman played RUTH Handler in the movie. - AGATHA (42A: Mystery writer Christie) It's always a good day when your favorite author shows up in the puzzle. AGATHA Christie (1890-1976) wrote over 66 mystery novels and 14 collections of short stories, as well as several plays. She is one of the best-selling fiction writers of all time. - TIKI (2D: Polynesian figurine) In Māori mythology (the Māori are indigenous people of New Zealand), TIKI was the first man created.

The cathedral is considered to be one of the finest examples of GOTHIC architecture. Notre Dame has been under renovation since a fire that occurred in April 2019. It reopened in December 2024. - PLATO (11D: Student of Socrates) Socrates (c.470 BCE-399 BCE) and PLATO (c. 428 BCE-348 BCE) were Greek philosophers. Most of what is known about Socrates is information gained from the accounts of his students, of which PLATO was one. Both Socrates and PLATO are considered foundational in developing the ideas of Western Philosophy. - KATSU (12D: Breaded Japanese dish from the English word ""cutlet"") Chicken KATSU is a dish of chicken cutlets coated with panko bread crumbs and then fried. It is sometimes referred to as panko chicken, and is related to the dish tonkatsu, which is breaded, fried pork cutlets. - MLS (20D: L.A. Galaxy's org.) The LA Galaxy is a professional soccer club that competes in Major League Soccer (MLS). The LA Galaxy are based in the Greater Los Angeles area in California. - MOESHA (24D: '90s sitcom starring Brandy) Singer, songwriter, and actress Brandy played the title role in the TV series, MOESHA, which aired for six seasons beginning in 2001. MOESHA was a high school student living with her family in Los Angeles. Each episode of the show (in the first five seasons) began with MOESHA speaking her thoughts into her diary. - CATS (26D: ""The Jellicle Ball"" musical) CATS is a musical by Andrew Lloyd Webber based on T. S. Eliot's 1939 poetry collection, Old Possum's Book of Practical CATS. ""The Jellicle Ball"" is a song in the musical. The event it refers to – the Jellicle Ball – is an annual ritual in which the CATS decide who will be chosen to ascend to the Heaviside Layer (a CAT version of heaven). Obviously my CAT, Willow, is a fan of this answer. Here she is overseeing my moves as I play Wordle. - EMMA (53D: Titular Jane Austen protagonist) Jane Austen's novel, EMMA, was originally published in 1815. The titular protagonist, EMMA, is a young woman with a propensity toward matchmaking and meddling in the lives of others.

79593553,SEC acknowledges Grayscale’s XRP ETF filing – Will this push altcoin to $3?,Speculation about any altcoin's ETF odds are all the rage these days.,"[Ripple](https://ambcrypto.com/category/xrp-ripple-news/) SEC acknowledges Grayscale’s XRP ETF filing – Will this push altcoin to $3? - Grayscale’s XRP ETF acknowledgment could pave the way for a sign-off for similar applications - Will the ETF speculation fuel XRP’s recovery to the latest local peak of $3.4? The U.S SEC has acknowledged Grayscale’s XRP ETF 19b-4 [filing](https://www.sec.gov/files/rules/sro/nysearca/2025/34-102420.pdf), marking a new milestone for the altcoin. Especially since it is still in the middle of an ongoing lawsuit with the regulator. According to its filing, Grayscale seeks to convert its XRP Trust, which currently has $12.8M in assets under management (AUM), into a Spot ETF. Other potential issuers who filed similar applications, like Canary Fund, 21Shares, WisdomTree, and Bitwise, are expected to get similar sign-offs too. For the products to begin trading, S-1 or the SEC registration statement form, must also be signed off. As far as standard procedure is concerned, the regulator could take another 240 days to approve or deny the products’ entry into the market. Will the lawsuit against Ripple be dropped? As expected, the signing off of the 19b-4 filing elicited many reactions from the crypto-community. Commenting on the development, Nate Geraci of ETF Store viewed the update as an “enormous message.” He [stated](https://x.com/NateGeraci/status/1890232087325864225), “Shocked more people aren’t talking about SEC accepting XRP ETF filing…They have open litigation w/ Ripple. Meanwhile, they just acknowledged filing of ETF holding asset in dispute (they easily could have rejected this filing). Enormous message IMO.” For her part, FOX Business reporter Eleanor Terrett stated that while the move is a sign of SEC’s ‘open-mindedness,’ it didn’t guarantee automatic approval. She [said](https://x.com/EleanorTerrett/status/1890182783730888827), “No, it doesn’t mean automatic approval … So why is it notable? Because it means this SEC is being more open-minded and not flat-out refusing to consider these products.” For context, issuers withdrew their SOL ETF applications in December after the previous SEC regime signaled it wouldn’t engage with them. What this means is that there has been a shift in the attitudes of the regulator recently. More and more people are optimistic too. In fact, Polymarket’s approval [odds](https://polymarket.com/event/ripple-etf-approved-in-2025?tid=1739533634894) for an XRP ETF in 2025 have risen to 80% in the last 30 days. On the price charts, XRP climbed by 15% in just three days recently. At press time, the altcoin was valued at $2.7, about 25% away from its latest all-time high of $3.4. According to crypto analyst Ali Martinez, [XRP](https://ambcrypto.com/predictions/ripple-price-prediction) could reclaim $3 soon.

79593568,Elon Musk's politics: Dissecting the shift from left to right,The world’s richest man and his galactic voyage from Biden-voting liberal to AfD cheerleader,"For three decades after he arrived in North America as a teenager, Mr Musk cleaved closely to the instinctive liberalism of most of his Silicon Valley peers. He voted for Obama, Hillary Clinton and Joe Biden. He called himself a “centrist.” He was embarrassed by his South African father voicing his approval of Donald Trump at dinner parties. Then, quite suddenly, he not only endorsed the Republicans but campaigned for Mr Trump; and, at the president’s inauguration, extended his right arm in a... well, let's just call it an instantly recognisable gesture associated with right-wing politics. Mr Musk is far from alone in abandoning middle-of-the-road liberalism. But few wield such enormous power. In appointing him to run the “Department of Government Efficiency,” Mr Trump has granted Mr Musk the authority to reshape America and its place in the world. With carte-blanche to cut two trillion dollars from the Federal budget, he has fired thousands of government employees and shut down whole departments. A recent weekend spent “feeding USAid into the woodchipper,” sparked chaos around the world and destroyed 60 years of soft-power diplomacy. Mr Musk said in an Oval Office press conference that his mission is to “restore democracy.” His opponents say he is acting illegally. What is certain is that his ambitions go well beyond the United States; he has intervened in both German and British politics to endorse populist, anti-immigration parties. Understanding his motives might tell us what comes next. The Telegraph spoke to half a dozen people who personally know or have known Mr Musk. They paint a picture of an imaginative and hard-working, but also thin-skinned and impulsive, individual with long-held beliefs about free speech, space exploration and his own special role in shaping mankind’s pan-galactic future. And while different associates point to different turning points, all agree that Mr Musk’s sharp rightward shift was propelled by a series of personal grievances. OUT OF AFRICA Elon Musk was born in Pretoria in 1971, and spent his formative years in the privileged and somewhat oblivious world of apartheid South Africa’s English-speaking white middle class. Much has been made of his upbringing in the racially segregated country. More than one of his enemies have suggested he must, consciously or unconsciously, carry the prejudices of apartheid in his worldview. Steve Bannon, the Right-wing ideologue who briefly served as a strategist and chief of staff in Mr Trump’s first administration, called white South Africans “the most racist people on earth” in a furious attack on Mr Musk last month. Others paint a more nuanced picture. His father Errol Musk, who was briefly a member of the anti-apartheid Progressive Party, told The Telegraph that Elon, along with his brother and sister, grew up with basically liberal outlooks. But he said they also learnt to avoid politics in general when they moved to America because of the stigma that being a white South African then carried with it. Whatever the truth of this, Mr Musk himself says one part of his foundational philosophy was indeed laid down at the time. “I had sort of an existential crisis when I was, I don't know, 12 or 13, about the meaning of life. I read many of the religious texts and books on philosophy, you know I was like reading [Arthur] Schopenhauer and [Friedrich] Nietzsche and whatnot,” he told Alice Weidel, the leader of the far-Right Alternative for Germany (AfD), in a live-streamed conversation last month. “But then, I read The Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy,” Mr Musk added. In Douglas Adams’s comic masterpiece, a race of super-intelligent beings builds a supercomputer to find “the answer to the great question of life, the universe and everything”. The computer gives the answer “42” – but says it would need a more powerful computer to work out what the actual question is in order to make sense of it. That, says Mr Musk, “led me to conclude that we should aspire to expand the scope and scale of consciousness, so that we're better able to know what questions to ask about the nature … about the answer that is the universe.” He added: “So we should just seem to take the set of actions that lead to a greater understanding of the universe.” MOSTLY HARMLESS? The path from Douglas Adams-inspired consciousness expansion to shredding chunks of the American government and endorsing the German far-Right is not an obvious one. Yet many of Mr Musk’s acquaintances believe this basic quest still guides him today – even, his recent sudden turn to Mr Trump, his gleeful destruction of USAid, his embrace not only of the populist but the extreme Right in America, Britain and Germany. “That's his favourite book. And everything is inspired by [the book],” insists Naomi Seibt, the Right-wing German freelance journalist who introduced Mr Musk to the AfD. “If you ask Grok [X’s AI tool] what Elon Musk is inspired by it will give cultural examples but it’s always going to mention The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy because for him it’s about discovering the secrets of the universe,” she adds. AMERIKKKA In the summer of 1989, a slight, gawky 17-year-old Mr Musk arrived at a grain and oilseed farm near the remote town of Swift Current in Saskatchewan, Canada. Mike Teulon, his cousin, remembered a hard-working, “down-to-earth” kid who pitched in around the yard. Mr Musk was not there for agriculture, however. He was draft-dodging to avoid being sent to fight in South Africa’s border war in Namibia and Angola. He never left North America. In 1992 Mr Musk moved from university in Ontario to Pennsylvania on an exchange programme. Two summers later, he ended up in California’s Silicon Valley working two internships at once, at an energy storage start-up by day and a video game company by night. By 1995 he was in California and working in the sector in which he would make his fortune, launching an online Yellow Pages directory with his brother Kimbal called Zip2. After the pair sold the company, Musk set up the payments company PayPal, whose sale to eBay would net Mr Musk a $176 million fortune. MARS Mr Musk showed little interest in politics for most of the next few decades, although those who worked with him noticed several threads that would have a direct impact on his transformation in the 2020s. The first was an obsession with the Red Planet. After making his first fortune with PayPal, Mr Musk began to think about what to do with his new money. Settling on space exploration and electric cars, he cold-called Jim Cantrell, an American rocket expert who had worked on Mars projects for the French space agency. “It was a Friday afternoon, and I was on my way home from work … and he called me, and, started telling me that he got my name from a mutual friend, and he needed to buy Russian rockets for [the] Mars mission he wanted to do, and I was the guy to call. And so that kind of started things out,” said Mr Cantrell. “From the start, he was talking about Mars. It's all about Mars. Everything he does is about Mars. That's what I just got. Everything Elon does is about Mars. “For years, people thought I was the lunatic by proclaiming this, and in fact, now he's saying it openly.” The Russia rocket deal never took off. But Mr Cantrell would become one of the founding consultants in the establishment of SpaceX. He remains convinced that Mr Musk’s embrace of Mr Trump is just one more step towards the dream of not only of reaching Mars, but of settling it and building a self-sustaining city. “There might be a bit of ‘f– you to the Left, because we all have those kinds of sentiments about people who've underestimated us or tried to hold us down unfairly. But I think if you view the majority of his interest here, it's going to be going to Mars,” said Mr Cantrell. “With Trump, I think he believes that he can co-opt the US government to help in going to Mars.” OBSESSION The unrelenting focus on Mars was just one example of a characteristic single-mindedness, bordering on obsessiveness, that acquaintances say he applies to everything. “He's extremely focused, he's extremely bright, he's technically very competent, and he is pretty attuned to business opportunities,” said Prof Sir Martin Sweeting, founder and executive chairman of Surrey Satellite Technology, a space start-up that Mr Musk invested in during SpaceX’s early years. “But he is, as I say, very, very focused. And you know, he's not particularly concerned about collateral damage in that process,” added Sir Martin. “He has very clear views as to what he thinks the solutions are to particular technical issues. And so if you agreed with him, you know, that was great. But if you had a different view, then, then that was going to be pretty hard to fight, unless – and it was probably fairly rare, that you could prove that he was wrong in the technical sense,” he added. One result is that SpaceX acquired a reputation for a high rate of staff turnover, as those exhausted by Mr Musk’s work schedule or frustrated by his vetoing of their ideas left. “Either you’re with Elon, or you’re just not part of his work,” said one former employee who asked to remain anonymous. The flip side of this one-track mind is a sensitivity to criticism that could prove distracting, even crippling. ""He was totally preoccupied with what people were saying about this or that on Twitter,” said a former Tesla employee who worked with Musk during that era. ""It was almost paralysing. You would be in a meeting and he would see a critical tweet and, off the cuff, change a whole plan we had spent weeks on."" In 2018, Vernon Unsworth, a British cave diver involved in the rescue of a group of trapped Thai schoolchildren, sued Mr Musk for calling him a “pedo guy” after Mr Unsworth accused him of using the emergency for a PR stunt. Mr Musk won the case after his lawyers successfully argued he had apologised and deleted the offending tweet. But it was symptomatic of how his quick temper and instant tweeting could land him in trouble. “He's absolutely brilliant. He's probably the most brilliant guy I've ever met. He's impatient. He doesn't suffer fools lightly or politely. And I think fools started about IQ of 120 and down for him. And he's quick to jump to conclusions,” said Mr Cantrell. ABSOLUTE FREEDOM That character flaw would soon clash with the third plank of Mr Musk’s character: his self-image as a “free speech absolutist.” He has referred to the position as being akin to a ""Kobayashi Maru problem"" - a reference to a test cadets in Star Trek were expected to take, that was impossible to pass. Critics these days say Mr Musk’s free speech evangelism just means his freedom to decide what other people say. X, after all, has been accused of blocking the accounts of critical journalists since he acquired the platform. Yet his rhetoric seems to draw on a genuine and long-held belief in the dangers of censorship – however badly he lives up to it today. On Sept 11 2001, Mr Musk and Mr Cantrell spent an exhausting and terrifying day trying to locate a friend who lived next door to the World Trade Centre. The man was eventually found alive – he had managed to get out before the towers collapsed. In the evening, as they tried to process the enormity of events, Mr Musk made a prediction. “He said: ‘You know, this used to be the greatest country in the world, but it can't be now, because in order to protect ourselves from this kind of threat, the government will have absolutely no alternative but to curtail civil liberties, and that that is going to be the death of this country’. “And he said that includes free speech. And it was at that point I realised, wow, it’s really fundamental to him,” said Mr Cantrell. “He was proved right, by the way.” This was the Elon Musk who became the richest man in the world almost exactly 20 years later: a wildly successful, highly driven Silicon Valley CEO with a social media addiction, a prickly sensitivity to criticism, and few political convictions beyond the importance of free speech and the imperative of colonising Mars. His father Errol, with whom Mr Musk has had a strained relationship, says at this stage his children in America were as instinctively liberal as their A-list Californian celebrity friends. THE BIDEN SNUB The turning point for Elon, says Errol, came in August 2021, when Joe Biden gathered the CEOs of America’s leading car makers at the White House to discuss how selling electric vehicles (EVs) could generate jobs. There was one notable absence. Tesla was the biggest electric car maker by sales at the time, but Mr Musk had not been invited. He took it as a snub. Whatever the cause of the rift – both men hinted that it was about Tesla’s use of non-unionised labour – the antipathy was mutual. Mr Biden later pointedly refused to mention Mr Musk or Tesla when referencing the electric car revolution, instead congratulating General Motors for leading the way. By January 2022, Mr Musk was calling Mr Biden “a damp sock puppet in human form” and accusing him of “treating the American public like fools.” In March 2022, after decades of voting Democrat, he publicly endorsed the Republican Party. INTO THE CULTURE WAR In normal times, the richest man in America backing the party of low taxes and small government might not be much to write home about. But the balance of power between owners and workers, the central political axis of the 20th century – and Joe Biden’s political career – is only a side-show in the current battle for America. “That Biden didn't invite the guy who was probably the biggest EV manufacturer at the time to the EV summit was a deliberate snub, without a doubt, for reasons I don't know,” said Mr Cantrell. “But what's kind of funny about the Biden thing is it was really reflective of this larger issue.” As Mr Musk’s rift with Mr Biden and the Democrats grew, he suddenly came under attack from Left-wing elements for whom he had previously been an idol. “I think he had a bit of an awakening about what's really going on politically in this country, that – both sides do it, but I think the Left is far more guilty of it – of demonising people who don't believe in them, which is, I think, offensive to his sense of free speech,” said Mr Cantrell. “So I think Biden opposing him was much more fundamental: It was a trigger.” It was at this point, said Errol Musk, that Elon decided to buy Twitter – largely in response to the amount of vociferous criticism he was getting from other users. As he fell out with Mr Biden, Mr Musk was enduring a more personal family drama that would drive him full-throttle into the great American culture war. In April 2022, Xavier Alexander Musk, Elon’s 18-year-old son, filed a petition with the Los Angeles County Superior Court, in Santa Monica, asking to be legally recognised as female. It was immediately clear that this was about a deep family rift as well as gender reassignment: the petition requested not only the recognition of new female Christian names – Vivian Jenna – but also a change of surname, as “I no longer live with or wish to be related to my biological father in any way, shape or form.” Vivian Jenna Wilson came out as transgender at the age of 16. She was living with her mother, the Canadian author Jennifer Wilson, but, as a minor, needed the permission of both parents for medical treatment. Mr Musk granted permission, but in 2024 complained he had been “essentially tricked” into signing documents authorising medical treatment for transition by “evil” doctors. “I was told Xavier might commit suicide … [it was] incredibly evil and I agree that people who have been promoting this should go to prison,” he said in an interview with Dr Jordan Peterson, a Canadian psychologist. “My son Xavier is dead. Killed by the woke mind virus.” Vivian Wilson has strongly rejected her father’s account, telling NBC that he was well aware of the side effects of the medicine and that he was so absent during her childhood he had little idea what she was like anyway. What is certain is that the saga deeply affected Mr Musk. Deeply enough for it to become another of his burning, single-minded obsessions. “I vowed to destroy the woke mind virus after that,” he told Dr Peterson. “And we are making some progress.” BRITAIN We can track Mr Musk’s rapid political transformation through this period in his prolific posts on X. Between 2022 and 2023 his politically-themed posts nearly quadrupled, according to analysis by The Telegraph, while posts about Tesla and Space X dropped off. The surge in political tweets was powered firstly by an increase in posts about US politics and Mr Trump. But he was also writing more and more posts with terms like “woke mind virus”, “snowflake”, “PC Police”, “red pill” and “social justice warrior”. He also just began tweeting more. His total number of posts per year more than doubled during the period. From 5,330 in 2022 to 13,313 in 2023. The total increased further in 2024. Was all this part of the plan to expand human consciousness and reach Mars? Or was it a distraction? He was certainly getting into time-consuming public feuds, often defined by the same pattern of a snub followed by a single-minded pursuit of the grudge. When riots broke out in Britain following the Southport killings in 2024, Mr Musk replied to an X post blaming the violence on uncontrolled immigration with the words: “Civil war is inevitable”. The British government accused him of pouring fuel on the flames of disorder, and refused to invite him to an investment conference in October. Musk fumed that he did not “think anyone should go to the UK when they’re releasing convicted paedophiles in order to imprison people for social media posts.” Sir Kier Starmer’s premiership was apparently added to the list of things Mr Musk became determined to delete. But an attempt to build an alliance with Britain’s populist Right has been strained by similar behaviour. In the summer of 2024, as his interest in British race relations was picking up, Mr Musk replied to a video posted on X by Nigel Farage, the leader of Reform UK. They finally met in person at Mr Trump’s Mar-a-Lago residence in December, and there was briefly talk of a $100 million (£81 million) donation to the party. But when Mr Farage diplomatically challenged Mr Musk’s support for Tommy Robinson, a former BNP member who the British politician considers toxic, Mr Musk posted: “The Reform party needs a new leader. Farage doesn’t have what it takes.” Mr Farage has tried to laugh off the spat. “I found him very easy to talk to, very straightforward. People say he’s weird – well, he wasn’t,” said Mr Farage of their meeting at Mar-a-Lago. “He happens to take a different view of that particular individual.” Mr Musk’s view, he suggested, was not unusual among Americans who are unfamiliar with Robinson but “see the crackdown on free speech and the shutting down of debate, they can’t quite believe it and they see anyone who fights that and champions the fight back as good.” But Mr Farage is both a talented communicator and knows much more about the electoral landscape in Britain. Surely Musk took it on board when he explained his reservations about Robinson? “Well, I don’t know about that,” said Mr Farage. The tensions remain. Last month Mr Farage said X should remove a terror video which was watched by Axel Rudakubana, the Southport attacker, shortly before he murdered three children. However, in accordance with Mr Musk’s views on free speech, the video, which shows the stabbing of a bishop at an Australian church, is still there. GERMANY Things went better for Mr Musk’s politics-by-X in Germany. In the summer of 2024, roughly the same time he reached out to Mr Farage, Mr Musk replied to a post by Ms Seibt by asking: “Why is it that every time I interact or I say anything about the AfD, I get so much negative feedback, am I missing something?” “Not too long later he contacted me again to ask the same question in a private message, asking me what the AfD is all about,” she told The Telegraph. Ms Seibt was happy to help and quickly won a convert to the AfD’s cause. He began to post on X in support of the party. In December, Mr Musk wrote an article in Welt am Sonntag declaring the AfD as the ""last spark of hope"" for Germany, which he claimed was on ""the brink of economic and cultural collapse."" The following month, at Ms Seibt’s suggestion, he invited Ms Weidel to the conversation on X, where he explained his attachment to The Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy. During the hour-long conversation, he also declared: “People really need to get behind the AfD, otherwise things are going to get very, very much worse in Germany.” Ms Weidel claimed that Hitler was not Right-wing. Two weeks later he popped up on a video link at an AfD rally in the German city of Halle, and told the crowd that the country had too much focus on “past guilt”. He added: “It’s good to be proud of German culture, German values, and not to lose that in some sort of multiculturalism that dilutes everything.” The AfD says it wants to reduce immigration, and slash taxes and regulations to boost economic growth. Its published manifesto, Mr Musk argues, is neither racist nor fascistic – ergo charges of fascism are mere smears. But it is what is not in the manifesto that alarms the AfD’s detractors. Germany’s domestic intelligence agency considers the AfD’s youth wing an extremist organisation. In November the party had to expel three members for membership of a militant group planning an armed revolt. Last year it was embarrassed by a prominent member defending the honour of the Waffen SS. Olaf Scholz, the German chancellor, called Mr Musk's intervention a “disgusting” disservice to the memory of the Holocaust. The comment editor of Welt am Sonntag also resigned in protest at having to publish the article. Christian Wagner, a historian who runs the Buchenwald concentration camp memorial, said Mr Musk was a “mixture of mad and Right-wing extremist"" to believe such things. WELLBEING Madness has been posited before to explain Mr Musk’s erratic behaviour, not least by Seth Abramson, a critic of Mr Musk who claims to have written the equivalent of two biographies about the Space X founder. . Could it explain his political evolution? In January 2024, The Wall Street Journal reported that executives at Tesla and SpaceX were worried that his alleged use of drugs, including LSD, cocaine, ecstasy, mushrooms and ketamine, was clouding his judgment. Mr Musk dismissed the story, saying he took voluntary drug tests because of a contract with Nasa and had never tested positive. Perhaps it is not chemical. He certainly seems to be getting what most people would consider an unhealthy amount of screentime, and a debilitating lack of sleep. According to our data, Musk has tweeted 7,651 times since Mr Trump was elected President on Nov 5. Between then and Dec 31 2024 – an average of 134 tweets per day. A visualisation of his posting patterns shows he has recently been posting almost constantly at all hours of the day. These are not scheduled tweets, either: most of his posts now are replies, often one-word comments or emojis. “If you sort of start to get involved in the internet sphere, it's very easy, I think, for you to sort of drive yourself down your own rabbit holes,” reflects Sir Martin. “Possibly that's part of it. And then if you combine that with his sort of innate character, which is very focused, very, very high contrast, very high self-confidence, and now he has the wherewithal to do whatever he wants – maybe that's the result that you get out the end.” Ms Seibt, one of the few people Mr Musk has spoken to at any length about politics, believes there is little mystery. “The truth is that everything that he puts out there is actually just him, that's really him. And when he says that his main motivation is to take us to Mars – and that's to put it plainly … his main motivation is to prevent us from extinction and to help humanity thrive and take us into a better future. That's actually what his goal is,” she told The Telegraph. “That's why every single thing that he does, like when he advocates for free speech, when he tries to save the West and our Western culture and everything – he wants to literally expand consciousness.” She added: “And that's what he's doing with his AI programs, with Neuralink, for example ... His goal is to build this kind of supercomputer because he's so inspired by his favourite book, The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy.” Re-reading the book with this in mind, it is difficult to work out how anyone reasoned their way from Arthur Dent’s misadventures in space to the gleeful destruction of America’s overseas aid and development agency. And yet, it is easy to find traces of Mr Musk in Douglas Adams’s universe. There is a smattering of Ford Prefect, Arthur Dent’s alien friend from Betelgeuse, in his struggles with human social cues. But, in his publicly curated eccentricity, he resembles above all Zaphod Beeblebrox, the celebrity who runs for president of the galaxy just so he can steal the infinite improbability drive – a device that solves the problem of interstellar travel by putting you everywhere in the universe all at once. How else could Mr Musk simultaneously run seven companies; colonise Mars; fire thousands of American civil servants; defeat the “woke mind virus”; direct Right-wing takeovers in Germany and Britain, and spend all day glued to his phone and compulsively posting on X? There is no doubt that many who know Mr Musk personally are convinced of his benevolence. Walter Isaacson, his authorised biographer – who is currently refusing press requests to comment on Mr Musk’s recent behaviour – said in 2023 that Mr Musk was motivated not by money or power, but by missions “that came when he was a little kid sitting in the corner reading the superhero comics.” Mr Isaacson argued there was an epic goodness to taking humanity into space, solving the problem of sustainable energy, and preventing artificial intelligence turning evil. Others, however, see nothing grander than vanity, greed and supreme arrogance. “Elon is not a Nazi per se,” Philip Low, a Silicon Valley start-up entrepreneur who claims to have known Mr Musk for 14 years, wrote after the arm-extending incident. “Nazis believed that an entire race was above everyone else. Elon believes he is above everyone else.” “All his talk about getting to Mars to ‘maintain the light of consciousness’ or about ‘free speech absolutism’ is actually BS Elon knowingly feeds people to manipulate them. Everything Elon does is about acquiring and consolidating power. That is why he likes far-Right parties, because they are easier to control,” he went on. Mr Low did not respond to emailed requests for comment. Mr Musk did not respond to requests to comment on Mr Low’s allegations. “This isn't complicated to understand,” Connecticut senator and Musk critic Chris Murphy commented after Marco Rubio, Mr Trump’s secretary of state, announced he would not attend a G20 summit in South Africa. “Elon Musk's Starlink was denied a licence in South Africa and so he's been on a revenge campaign to get them to reverse their decision,” Mr Murphy added. PAX MUSKIANA In the past two weeks, Mr Musk has realised many of his political goals. In a magnificent revenge for Mr Biden’s White House snub, he now has free access to the Oval Office and a free hand to fire as many federal employees as he sees fit. His war on gender transition is also going well. On Jan 29, Mr Trump signed an executive order calling on the Health and Human Services secretary to ""take all appropriate actions to end the chemical and surgical mutilation of children"". Most gratifying of all, Mr Trump, in his inauguration speech, promised the US would launch astronauts to plant the “stars and stripes” on Mars. Along the way, Mr Musk has acquired awesome political power, directing his Praetorian Guard of 20-something programmers into all corners of the American state. This week Time magazine ran a front cover of Mr Musk sitting behind the presidential desk in the Oval Office – a far from subtle comment about where real power lies in the Trump White House.

79593573,"Colony of endangered spiders halts Government's plans for 1,300 new homes",Development abandoned after Natural England issues part of Kent location with environmental order to protect rare arachnids,"A small colony of endangered spiders has halted the development of more than a thousand new homes in a blow to the Government’s growth plans. Plans to build hundreds of new houses and flats in Ebbsfleet in Kent have been abandoned after Natural England designated part of the Government-approved location - a filled-in quarry and the cleared site of a former cement works next to a railway station - as a Site of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI). The designation was necessary to protect a colony of [rare “distinguished jumping spiders”](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/books/what-to-read/spider-how-golden-mole-author-katherine-rundell-learned-love/) from developers, Natural England said, even though doing so obstructed part of a £300 million Government-backed plan to build a new town. Ian Piper, chief executive of the Government-backed Ebbsfleet Development Corporation (EDC), confirmed the environmental order would affect plans for homes saying an estimated 1,300 properties slated for development would be lost. It will be seen as a blow to Rachel Reeves and the Labour government which has put house building [at the heart of its plans to boost growth](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/money/property/not-enough-workers-to-meet-rayners-15m-housebuilding-target/) and kickstart the economy. The Chancellor announced a major change to planning rules in January, saying she would strip green quangos of their powers to block building, saying they have wielded an “oversized say on the future of our economy”. Her comments were echoed by Angela Rayner, the deputy prime minister, who said this week, as she unveiled plans to [slash red tape](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/2025/02/08/rayner-must-speed-planning-reforms-says-antonio-simoes-lg/) in the planning system: “We’re tackling the housing crisis head-on – for everyone who needs a safe home.” ‘Ludicrous situation’ Steve Norris, the Conservative former transport minister, who until last year chaired a company that tried to build a £2.5 billion theme park in the area in parallel with the planned Ebbsfleet Garden City, described the SSSI situation as “ludicrous”. “All I can tell you is that until Angela Rayner, to her credit, grasped the great crested newt, bats and jumping spider issue, a development corporation established by the Government for the express purpose of delivering much-needed housing was prevented - by an agency set up by that same Government - from delivering those homes, for reasons which it had no obligation to justify,” said Mr Norris. “In any other democratic country that ludicrous situation would never have been allowed to persist”. He added the Ebbsfleet situation was “one of the clearest examples of just how awful we are at delivering big infrastructure - and, in the process, deterring private capital from funding big investments.” With house prices in Ebbsfleet averaging about £400,000, according to property website Rightmove, protecting the spiders has potentially blocked more than £500 million worth of economic activity from property sales alone. Derelict land just south of the River Thames was bought for £32 million by the Government-sponsored Ebbsfleet Development Agency in 2019, paving the way for the construction of 15,000 new homes. The 125-hectare site, which stretches from the banks of the Thames down to a railway junction some 20 miles east of London, includes a filled-in quarry and the former site of a cement works. It sits directly next to Ebbsfleet Station, from where high-speed trains reach the capital in just 18 minutes. Mr Piper, the EDC boss, insisted that the SSSI had “not affected delivery of the majority of new homes” at Ebbsfleet, but conceded that the designation had blocked construction on a parcel of land known as Ebbsfleet Central West, immediately next to the railway station. Development of SSSIs is effectively impossible because of draconian controls placed on construction, sources familiar with planning permission law said.

79593575,The full English that won’t give you a heart attack (and yes it includes bacon),There’s nothing better than a proper cooked breakfast. Here’s how to get the day off to a heart-healthy start (and save over 700 calories),"“The idea of the English breakfast is infinitely more interesting than a plate of breakfast foods should be,” says the English Breakfast Society (yes, there really is such a thing as the English Breakfast Society). Eggs, bacon, sausages, tomato, mushrooms – perhaps some beans and fried bread on the side. Each on their own a prosaic food, but in combination – irresistible. What is it about the good old fry up that has stood the test of time? It’s as English a ritual as complaining about the weather or losing a World Cup semi-final. The cooked breakfast transcends social boundaries, from the formica table of a lorry drivers’ café, to a hungover feast the morning after an Oxbridge ball. Whether we’re on a country-house mini break, or feeding visiting relatives in the kitchen, the full English is the breakfast of choice. TC Callis is a nutritionist and the author of The Building Blocks of Life: A Nutrition Foundation for Healthcare Professionals. “The meal itself started in the Regency period, when upper-class families would gather to eat vast breakfasts such as devilled kidneys, sausages and black pudding,” she says. “Everyone else would eat porridge, or gruel. “But as the middle-classes expanded during the Industrial Revolution, so did the English [breakfast](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/health-fitness/diet/nutrition/breakfast-myths/), which pretty much resembles the plateful we see today.” Meat, fat and eggs were rationed during the Second World War, but after the middle of the 20th century, industrial farming increased, making meat, dairy, eggs, and other foods more readily available. As joyous an occasion as an English breakfast can be, it does come with a health warning. “A cooked breakfast is one of my favourite meals,” says Nicola Marsh, a registered dietitian and sports nutritionist. “And while it’s entirely possible to eat this meal in a health-promoting way, you definitely need to think about your heart. “For example, fried foods do not have the healthiest fatty-acid profile. This is largely down to the presence of saturated fat, so-called because of the large number of hydrogen atoms surrounding each carbon atom in the make-up of the food.” “Saturated fat is linked with the build-up of LDL [low-density lipoprotein] [cholesterol](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/health-fitness/diet/weight-loss/harvard-diet-cholesterol/),” Marsh continues. “In turn, LDL cholesterol is linked with atherosclerosis plaques in the bloodstream.” As these build up, the arteries narrow, reducing the supply of oxygen-rich blood to tissues and organs in the body, and increasing the risk of heart disease. For that reason, most nutrition experts recommend limiting saturated fat to under 10 per cent of calories a day. “There is a firm body of evidence that saturated fat from red and processed meats can also increase the risk of colorectal cancer,” says Sam Rice, The Telegraph’s nutritionist. “On the other hand, recent studies have found that saturated animal fats from dairy products may not be so problematic, as they contain other [nutrients](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/health-fitness/diet/nutrition/signs-nutrient-deficiency/) like calcium and potassium that can positively affect heart health, as well as probiotics that benefit gut health.” The message is that an English breakfast absolutely must be enjoyed – but as an occasional treat, rather than a daily ritual.

It was drafted after the Second World War and the [Holocaust](/latest/holocaust) to protect the people from the state and to ensure the atrocities committed would never be repeated. It was not about people being deprived of chicken nuggets and facilitating the activities of paedophiles and criminals. But as long as we have a government too weaselly to send these chancers back, an Attorney General, Lord Hermer, who’s publicly stated he won’t challenge ANY ECHR ruling AND armies of greedy human rights lawyers who will exploit ECHR laws for their own financial gain, we’re sunk.

[ 'Keir Starmer must sack anti-British appointee to prove he's not Sir Spineless' ](/news/politics/2014581/keir-starmer-anti-british) [LATEST] This week’s ruling by Judge Hugo Norton Taylor, who just happens to be the son of pro-Palestinian journalist and civil rights campaigner, to allow a Palestinian family to settle here could potentially open the flood gates to two million Palestinians at risk of displacement AND to people from conflict zones all over the world. Norton-Taylor said it was irrelevant he’d allowed them to come under a scheme meant for Ukrainians. Well, actually it wasn’t. He just decided it was and, in doing so, imposed his own DIY asylum policy. He also said the “public interest” was irrelevant to his decision which showed his total contempt for democracy. This man isn’t elected. It’s not his job to decide immigration policy and Starmer needs to slap him down pronto. Because what he did this week amounts to judicial activism in support of an agenda he knows the majority of Brits have rejected. The thing about Starmer and his band of muppets is that come the election we can kick them out – and we will. But judges and lawyers aren’t elected so when they behave badly, follow their own agendas, there’s sod all we can do which is why they’ve become as tyrannical as they now are. Sorry, but I don’t want a single Gazan refugee coming here. Apart from the fact we can’t cope with another influx, the fact is we have no way of assessing the risk (in the way we have with Ukrainians and people from Hong Kong). We have no idea if these people have been radicalised by Hamas. We DO know that a majority still vote for and support the terror group and refuse to acknowledge their atrocities. It also speaks volumes that [Egypt](/latest/egypt?pageNumber=2), Jordan, Saudi Arabia and Lebanon have all refused to take Palestinians. But a British judge says “Hey, come on down…” By 2032, our population will have soared to 72.5 million and 90% of that increase (6.6million people) will be solely down to immigration – that’s before you factor in Palestinians etc – and our infrastructure simply can’t take it. It will also be catastrophic financially and for social cohesion. Arrogant judges and lawyers allowing this to happen are a danger to our safety and our national security. And if we are to be kept safe they have to be made to butt out of politics, policy and democracy.

The astonishing figures belong to the [United States](/news/world/2013631/russia-us-ukraine-war-peace-talks-donald-trump), which is of course the world's largest economy and spends more on its defences and public services than any other nation. But the United States also has the world's largest GDP, with its population generating a total of £21 trillion a year. And because of its huge GDP the United States can trade off against its debts, so its actual debt-to-GDP ratio means it is not one of the world's most indebted nations. If using the debt to GDP ratio as measure then [Lebanon's](/news/world/1984465/israel-warns-hezbollah-of-widening) debt-to-GDP ration at 349.88% is the highest in the world, and the United States drops to spot 12 at 121.31%, according to [World Population Review](https://worldpopulationreview.com/country-rankings/countries-by-national-debt). According to US Treasury Fiscal Data most of the US debt is in government bonds, or US Treasuries which have been bought by investors and even countries around the world. Because of its huge economy the US is not, currently at least, in danger of default on its debt which is why governments around the world invest in US government bonds. Some of the biggest investors in the US will probably surprise most people.

Located just off the coast of the incredible and hugely popular city of [Venice](/latest/venice) lies an island with a far darker history, one a world away from the bustling floating city. Poveglia is a small island just off the [Italian](/latest/italy) coast and is shrouded in mystery and stories of [ghosts](/latest/ghosts). Made up of three small islands - two of which are natural - [Poveglia](/travel/articles/1967911/tiny-italian-island-venice-Poveglia-dark-tourism) now lies completely abandoned and has frequently featured on paranormal shows. The smallest is an octagon, used as a small fort to protect Venice, built around 1645 on orders from the Venetian government. For over a century, beginning in the 1770s, the island was used as a quarantine station for those suffering from the plague and other diseases. It later became a mental hospital, which closed in 1968. It has remained empty ever since. In 1776 the island became a checkpoint for goods and people coming to and from Venice by ship. However, in 1793 there were several cases of the plague on two ships and so the island was transformed into a temporary quarantine zone. This role became permanent under the rule of Napoleon Bonaparte and continued until 1814. Then, in 1922, the existing buildings were converted into a [psychiatric hospital](/news/uk/1959167/abandoned-mental-health-hospital-leeds-pictures) and was later used as a nursing home or long-term care facility until its closure. While efforts to redevelop the island into a luxury hotel have been made, including bids from Italian businessman and now mayor of Venice [Luigi Brugnaro](/travel/articles/1656844/venice-canal-anger-mayor-latest-news/1000), who planned to invest 20 million euros in a restoration plan, the island remains vacant. The surviving buildings on the island consist of a cavana (boat shelter), a church, a hospital, an asylum, a bell tower, housing, and administrative buildings for the staff. The bell tower is the most visible structure on the island and dates back to the 12th century. It was later converted into a lighthouse. The island was sealed off, leading to legends of terminally ill Venetians waiting to die before their ghosts returned to haunt the island. According to a 2014 report by the [Travel Channel](https://www.travelchannel.com/shows/ghost-adventures/articles/poveglia-islands-haunted-history), a doctor who allegedly experimented on patients with crude lobotomies jumped from the bell tower in the 1930s after claiming he had been driven mad by ghosts. Decades later, nearby residents claimed to still hear the bell despite the fact that it had been removed many years earlier. The report, titled ""Haunted History,"" also stated that some restoration work had started but “abruptly stopped without explanation.” Don't miss...

Opened in July 2022, the €420 million (£358 million) bridge connects the Croatian mainland with the Peljesac Peninsula, bypassing a narrow strip of land in [Bosnia and Herzegovina](/news/world/2005266/europes-deepest-river-tara-flows-two-countries). But the involvement of a Chinese state-owned company in the major EU-funded project has sparked debate about China's growing influence in the region. [BBC](https://www.express.co.uk/latest/bbc)'s Katya Adler, in her documentary The Balkans: Europe’s Forgotten Frontier, described the Pelješac Bridge as a significant symbol of China’s increasing presence in the Balkans, often dubbed China’s “gateway to Europe.” Adler questioned whether Europe is ""losing influence in its own backyard,"" pointing out that while the EU provided the funds, it was China that gained the most visibility and operational credit for the project. The Balkans have become a focal point for China’s Belt and Road Initiative, with Beijing investing billions in infrastructure projects, including highways, railways and energy facilities across the region. In a video at the time of the bridge opening, Chinese Prime Minister Li Keqiang said the bridge ""illustrates friendly relations"" between China and Croatia, as well as between China and the EU. Meanwhile, Croatian Prime Minister Andrej Plenković described “the project of the generation that has achieved such a great act of unification of Croatian territory”. The 2.4-kilometer (1.5-mile) long Peljesac Bridge serves as a vital connection between two parts of Croatia that were previously separated by a short stretch of Bosnian territory near the town of Neum. Before the bridge’s construction, travellers and goods had to cross border checks twice to reach the southern tourist hotspot of Dubrovnik from the rest of Croatia. Now, the bridge provides seamless access, reducing travel time, enhancing trade and supporting local businesses. The bridge is particularly significant for Croatia, which joined the [European Union](https://www.express.co.uk/latest/european-union) in 2013. The new infrastructure project not only fosters national unity but also strengthens the country's integration into the EU by improving internal connectivity. Local businesses, especially in tourism and agriculture, have seen substantial benefits, as goods and visitors can now travel more efficiently across the region. Don't miss...

The project’s success is attributed to meticulous planning, cutting-edge technology and international collaboration. Since its opening, the Peljesac Bridge has transformed the region’s economy. Dubrovnik, known for its medieval walls and as a filming location for Game of Thrones, has seen an influx of tourists who can now reach the city more conveniently.

Whilst the latest cruise ships offer plenty of luxurious features, some passengers can feel somewhat cramped, particularly if they have made the [common mistake](/travel/cruise/2002615/cruise-embarkation-day-advice-buffet-restaurants-packing) of [overpacking for the trip](/travel/cruise/2006700/cruise-expert-banned-items-carnival-royal-caribbean). To help tourists make the most of their cabin, the travel expert Ilana Schattauer from the [YouTube](/latest/youtube) channel [Life Well Cruised](https://www.youtube.com/@LifeWellCruised) posted [a video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPwAKCrXzSU) suggesting that passengers look under their sofa. She explained: ""This is one of my favourite things in this cabin. In the couch that you can see right behind me there are actually two drawers right underneath, and these can be used for extra storage. ""Now, if you have three or four people in the cabin, you'll definitely appreciate having those extra drawers. Plus, as my husband and I realised, we can actually put our shoes there. My husband took one drawer, I took the other, and now our shoes are out of sight!"" Most cruise ship cabins feature a two-seater sofa, which can typically be converted into another bed - particularly if three or more guests are sharing the same room. However, few passengers realise that the sofas found in cabins typically feature drawers underneath the cushions, which can be used for storing items such as shoes. Ilana also advised that cruise passengers check underneath the bed and around the mirrors in the bathroom to see whether the cabin features any other storage areas. Don't miss...

She added: ""Take a look inside your closet and you're usually going to find a mini safe. Now, even if you don't use this when you're in a hotel, I do suggest that you use this on a ship. You can use it to store your passports, anything else that's valuable like jewellery, money, or your car keys. ""And, by the way, if you're concerned about the safety and security of the safe in your cabin, my understanding is that cabin attendants cannot open them on their own - the only times they could do this is with a supervisor with them."" Finally, Ilana also highlighted that many cruise ship cabins feature a small clothesline within the shower that can be used to dry towels and swimwear. She continued: ""Heading into the bathroom, there is usually going to be a secret clothesline. ""Now, you're going to find this at the top of your shower, where you just pull a little silver tip and you'll find a little string that will go right across [the shower area].""",express.co.uk,https://www.express.co.uk/travel/cruise/2013610/cruise-cabin-hidden-feature-advice-storage-safe,[],"['Cruise Ship Cabin Tips', 'Hidden Features In Cruise Cabins', 'Princess Cruise Bathroom Amenities', 'Royal Caribbean Cruise Cabin Hidden Storage', 'Where To Store Luggage In A Cruise Cabin']",2025-02-14,2025-02-14,0,5,76,151,3755

Home of the Daily and Sunday Express. ](/) Ollie Watkins to Arsenal transfer theory after failed bid for Aston Villa star - EXCLUSIVE Arsenal made an attempt to sign Ollie Watkins close to transfer deadline day. [Arsenal](/latest/arsenal-fc) hero Ray Parlour has poured cold water on the suggestion that his former side were desperate to sign [Ollie Watkins](/latest/ollie-watkins) in January. The Gunners [made an official approach to Aston Villa for their talisman](/sport/football/2007803/Arsenal-Ollie-Watkins-transfer-Aston-Villa), after injuries to Gabriel Jesus and [Bukayo Saka](/latest/bukayo-saka) forced them to survey the market, but they were quickly rebuffed. [Villa](/latest/aston-villa-fc) were willing to part ways with one of their strikers, as Watkins competed for minutes with Jhon Duran, but once the [Colombian agreed a big-money move to Al-Nassr](/sport/football/2007383/aston-villa-transfer-news-jhon-duran-ollie-watkins-unai-emery) in Saudi Arabia, Watkins’ future was no longer up for debate. At 29, there was a feeling that it may be now-or-never for Watkins, a boyhood [Arsenal](https://www.express.co.uk/latest/arsenal-fc) fan who has [previously described a potential Emirates move as a ‘dream’](/sport/football/2007305/ollie-watkins-dream-transfer-arsenal-bid). That opportunity did arise, but Parlour believes that [Arsenal](https://www.express.co.uk/latest/arsenal-fc) did not push as hard as they would have if he were a top target for [Mikel Arteta](/latest/mikel-arteta) and the top brass. “You see the media reports about this bid and I’m not so sure,” Parlour told Express Sport with NetBet Sports Betting. “How much were [Arsenal](https://www.express.co.uk/latest/arsenal-fc) really interested in Watkins? I like Watkins, he is another top striker. “Scores plenty of goals and I think if [Arsenal](https://www.express.co.uk/latest/arsenal-fc) were really keen, then they would have pushed heavily for him.” Arteta admitted that he was disappointed not to get a deal for a striker over the line, with their misery compounded by injury to Gabriel Martinelli, leaving the Gunners with just [Kai Havertz](https://www.express.co.uk/latest/kai-havertz), Leandro Trossard, Ethan Nwaneri and Raheem Sterling as forward options. While [Kai Havertz suffered a torn hamstring on Arsenal's training camp](/sport/football/2013383/kai-havertz-injury-update-season-arsenal) in Dubai and will miss the remainder of the season. And Parlour expects that area to be addressed at the end of the season, with the likes of [Alexander Isak](/latest/alexander-isak) and Benjamin Sesko thought to be serious targets. “I would say in the summer, a striker is by far the number one priority for [Arsenal](https://www.express.co.uk/latest/arsenal-fc) and believe Mikel and the board are firmly looking to get their man,” Parlour added. “January is always a hard and difficult window to get players in, especially in striker position. But I can imagine Mikel and the board worked as hard as they could to get the right one in. ""You don’t want to waste money and bring in someone who isn’t going to benefit the team, so obviously their first choice wasn’t available now.

79593591,Gardens 'thrive in spring' with easy February chore that's a barrier to all pests,Garden experts recommend one simple method that insulates and protects vulnerable plants during winter.,"Gardens 'thrive in spring' with easy February chore that's a barrier to all pests Garden experts recommend one simple method that insulates and protects vulnerable plants during winter. In these colder months, [gardens](/latest/garden) are at the mercy of inclement weather and hungry creatures. Pests aren't limited to the warmer months, especially in winter when food is far and few between. Plants fall prey to [rats](/latest/rats), slugs and all sorts of pests looking for something to eat Lending a helping hand are the experts at Haon Garden Rooms who have shared their top tips for protecting your garden from pests this February. From forming a protective barrier, insulating [plants](/latest/gardening) and sealing your garden, here's how to guard against pests. Mulch insulates the soil, helping to regulate temperature and moisture, but it also serves as a barrier for pests. Once you’ve applied a thick layer of organic mulch - such as straw, leaves, or wood chips - around plants, it will help deter rodents and insects from burrowing into the soil while keeping plant roots warm and protected. Even young trees and shrubs can fall victim - rodents such as voles and rabbits may chew on their bark. Ensure you wrap them with a protective guard or mesh and surround shrubs with fencing to prevent rodents from gnawing on them. While you're in the garden, check for potential entry points. Rodents like mice and voles seek shelter in garden sheds, greenhouses, and under mulch, so seal up any holes or gaps in fences, sheds, and other structures. Consider placing hardware cloth around the base of plant beds or garden structures to keep rodents from burrowing in. It's also helpful to pull weeds out of your garden before they get too long, ensuring they don’t provide hiding spots or breeding grounds for insects and rodents. Inspect your garden occasionally throughout the February for signs of pests, such as chewed leaves or tracks if there's snow, as they can cause damage if left unchecked. Early detection allows you to take action before pests multiply. ""The run up to spring can be a challenging season for gardeners, but with some preparation, it's possible to protect your plants from the pests that seek refuge in the cold,"" said Jason Mennie, Haon Garden Rooms' managing director. ""By combining preventative measures such as cleaning up garden debris, using natural repellents, and encouraging beneficial wildlife, gardeners can ensure that their garden survives the winter months and is ready to thrive when spring arrives.""",express.co.uk,https://www.express.co.uk/life-style/garden/2014605/how-to-stop-rats-pests-garden-deterrent,[],"['Garden Protection', 'Garden Rat Deterrent', 'How To Stop Rats', 'How To Stop Rodents', 'Organic Mulch', 'Pest Control', 'Pests', 'Rat Deterrent', 'Rats', 'Rodents', 'Winter Gardening', 'Winter Gardening Tips']",2025-02-14,2025-02-14,0,12,81,103,2550

Her devoted fans lapped up the advice, with the post garnering thousands of likes. In the informative clip, Tanya begins by plunging her hands into a soapy bowl of water as the overlay text reads: ""How to properly deep clean a bedroom. Clean this way once a month – you'll have a super clean bedroom."" Her first golden rule is to ""always start with [washing curtains](/latest/chores)"". Next, she advises emptying the bedroom of as many items as possible. The third step involves stripping the mattresses and bedding and shifting the beds to clean underneath them. Tanya's fourth rule is to ""always clean top to bottom"", typically beginning at the window and dusting the walls. Meanwhile, her fifth tip is a gentle reminder not to overlook dusting the ceiling fan, if you have one. READ MORE: [ 'I'm a hotel worker – rooms aren't as clean as you think they are' ](/travel/articles/2013354/hotel-room-hotels-cleaning-cleaner-jobs) [CLEANING] The sixth rule focuses on cleaning the floorboards and prepping the floors for a deep clean. While the seventh rule also centres on the floors, with Tanya admitting she cleans them by hand ""since it's a deep clean"". Tanya's eighth tip for a thorough clean is to wipe down the legs of beds and other furniture, as they often harbour a lot of dust. Her second-to-last piece of advice is to focus on cleaning all the corners. Finally, once the corners are spotless, Tanya suggests tackling the main area. She recommends 'prepping the floor' by sweeping, then vacuuming, polishing, and drying it.

Express.co.uk visits Gosforth and chat to business owners A vibrant town that’s just minutes away from Newcastle city centre has become a [UK property hotspot.](/news/uk/2001859/uk-towns-house-prices-rising) Gosforth is a pretty little enclave that has always boasted an upmarket reputation - with Newcastle footballers often spotted milling about, including defender Lloyd Kelly and midfielder Sandro Tonali. It has precedent as being a bit of a footballer's favourite, with legendary England player Alan Shearer born and raised in the well-heeled suburb. Now the location is attracting even more attention as it has been listed as one of the places where [property prices are soaring](/news/uk/2010387/uk-seaside-town-cheap-north-shields) the most in Britain. A recent rundown from online property portal Rightmove listed Gosforth as fifth on its list of locations that had bucked the trend of a more muted price growth of 1.4% across Britain. In 2024 saw prices rocketed by 7.6% in Gosforth - with the average asking price rising from £280,886 in 2023 to £302,189. And if you’re still after bagging a property bargain Gosforth could be just the spot - with affordable options on the market, such as a £55,000 ground floor flat within easy walking distance of the cosmopolitan high street. Express.co.uk visited Gosforth to talk to those who live and work there about what they think is driving the property boom. Julie Harsted, 55, owns Julie’s Flowers on Gosforth High Street and has run the store for three and half years. She lives in Hebburn - which is around a 15 minute drive away - and is married to Gary, 47. She said: “We chose here because it’s a vibrant [part of] town and I’ve worked here before. I know what the footfall is like and people have got money here too.” Julie says they’d most definitely consider relocating to the area - and loves the buzz on the main shopping stretch. She said: “There are more independent shops coming in - nice shops. It’s always had a nice reputation. I would love to live in Gosforth. My business is here and I love the area. I would consider relocating.” Adriano Addis, 65, is a huge fan of Gosforth. He runs a restaurant and deli on the High Street - Adriano’s - and is married to Nicole Addis, 59, a psychotherapist. The pair have two children. He said: “Property prices have risen. The older generation died off and passed their properties onto their children - and their families have become professionals. I would highly recommend it as a place to live.” The businessman says that a lot of the properties on the market currently are between the £800,000 and £1m mark - but that there still remains a good choice for different types of buyers. He said: “It’s very residential but still very central. It’s close to the airport and there are quite a lot of schools.” Don't miss...

She said: “I have noticed that property prices have gone up - and obviously [since [Covid](https://www.express.co.uk/latest/coronavirus)] it’s gone mad. I have no idea what’s driving it.” Victoria says that Gosforth is also attracting people from outside of the area who are relocating. She said: “I have noticed that there are a lot of people from down south coming to the area - quite a few of my customers are from down south. The community is the best bit - everybody helps each other out and they are very friendly. They now do an event in the park once a month with food stalls and craft stalls.” She added: “I would definitely consider moving here if I had the money!” Gosforth resident Stephen, a project manager in his 50s, agrees that property prices are on the up. Stephen, who didn’t want to give his second name, said: “I have noticed that they are definitely still going up. I think it’s a shortage that’s driving it. It’s a case of supply and demand. Lots of people want to live here and there aren’t more houses being built.” He added: “There are good schools, parks, lots of people who are similar to you. It has a good community feel - with cafes on the high street.” Clinical scientist Laura Hughes, 33, lives in Gosforth with her partner Philip Ruane, 32, and their baby boy Flynn, who is seven weeks old. They have lived in Gosforth for eight years - but have noticed even in that time that property prices are heading for the sky. She said: “I find for me it’s really family friendly and there is so much stuff going on. There are lots of nice cafes and lots of clubs and classes. It’s quite central but still quite quiet. I have got a car but don’t necessarily need one. I’m really glad I’m here.” Laura added: “We bought ours [house] about three years ago and are quite surprised to see how much that’s increased in value in a short period of time.” Spike Hale, 77, is a retired teacher from Gosforth who moved to the area in 1984. He and his wife, who didn’t wish to be named, have three children, six grandchildren and one great grandchild. He too has noticed that prices are soaring. Spike said: “We’re conscious of it and see some of the properties that have come on the market - nothing stays on the market very long. It’s very, very fast moving and there are not a lot of properties that stick.” The pensioner wouldn’t hesitate in giving it the thumbs up to others looking to relocate - but does have one word of warning. Spike added: “I would definitely recommend living here - but it’s becoming very expensive.” Property expert Andrew Boast, founder of SAM Conveyancing, agreed wholeheartedly with the views of Gosforth residents and business owners. He said: “Gosforth remains one of Newcastle's most sought-after neighbourhoods due to its top-rated schools, green spaces, and strong community feel. “Its excellent transport links into the city centre, combined with a vibrant high street filled with shops, cafes and restaurants, make it a perennial favourite among buyers - both those looking for a first home or a spot on a commuter belt.” He added: “It's this balance between urban convenience and suburban charm that continues to drive demand, pushing house prices upward as supply struggles to keep pace.”",express.co.uk,https://www.express.co.uk/news/uk/2014113/pretty-uk-town-gosforth-newcastle,['nct'],"['Financials', 'Footballers&#039', 'Gosforth', 'Newcastle Property Market', 'Rising House Prices', 'Stock', 'Suburb']",2025-02-14,2025-02-14,1,7,76,105,6863

However, over the years, the town has been witnessing a large number of tourists leading to traffic and parking issues. It has been now reported that the council is working on some measures to reduce the number of cars in the town centre by designating zones exclusively for vehicles owned and registered by residents. Tourists wishing to visit the town by car are advised to park at the outskirts of these zones and walk, with new car parks being planned to accommodate the demand, reports [The Majorca Daily Bulletin](https://www.majorcadailybulletin.com/news/local/2025/02/08/131063/hired-cars.html). One of the frequent visitors to Soller told the publication: ""Providing that there is parking I don't think that there will be a problem, but if there is no parking then it could be a nightmare."" Some car firms have expressed their unhappiness over the move to limit the number of hire cars. Othman Ktiri, CEO of car-hire firm OK Mobility, previously said in an interview with Majorca Daily Bulletin: ""You can't reduce the number of hire cars if you don't increase public transport. ""Anything that involves limiting the offer once the tourist has arrived in the destination would lead to greater chaos. ""No firm brings a single car to the islands thinking that it is not going to be hired. In addition, not all hire cars serve tourists, they also serve many residents."" Don't miss...

But is Trump really in control – or is he being played by others who are taking on the self-proclaimed master of the deal at his own game?","Trump is desperate to be a strong man – but other people are calling the shots The president has started his second-term with a blizzard of announcements, each one more controversial than the next, writes [Jon Sopel](/author/jon-sopel). But is Trump really in control – or is he being played by others who are taking on the self-proclaimed master of the deal at his own game? [Comments] Eight years ago, it became the laziest of Washington aphorisms to say that the presidency would change Donald [Trump](/topic/trump); Donald Trump would not change the presidency. It would be tempting to argue given the [snowmageddon blizzard of announcements](/tv/news/jimmy-fallon-elon-musk-son-trump-b2697489.html) that it is now totally the other way round. But maybe that doesn’t quite do it – is it possible, given the hugely significant announcements of the past few days, that the presidency is being shaped by those around him and not by Trump himself? Let’s agree on one thing from the outset that I think everyone can sign up to: Donald Trump represents a break with “politics as normal”. If we want to point to one visual symbol of that, it was – surely – Donald Trump sitting behind the Resolute Desk in the Oval Office with [Elon Musk](/topic/elon-musk) by his side and a small child on his head, pushing his black MAGA cap down over his eyes, while Dad was explaining that he had got it wrong over hundreds of millions of condoms being sent to Hamas fighters. They’d gone to Mozambique instead to tackle AIDS. Easy mistake to make, I guess. We’ll come back to X a little later – no not the social media platform; the little chap on Musk’s head. His name is X, too. Please try and keep up. But here was Musk, doing something that few are permitted to do. He was upstaging Donald Trump. [The cameras were on Musk as he sought to explain his work in DOGE ](/news/world/americas/us-politics/14-states-sue-doge-and-agent-of-chaos-elon-musk-b2698069.html)– the department of government efficiency. As Musk was arguing this was all about democratic accountability, my irony meter went straight to eleven. [Musk, who has been elected by no one –](/news/world/americas/elon-musk-openai-chatgpt-bid-b2697638.html) who has faced no confirmation hearing as his post is not a cabinet position, and whose department is not a government department, meaning his work cannot be scrutinised by congress – was providing a lecture on democratic accountability. His fear, he said, was America had ceased to be a democracy and had become a bureaucracy, run by a deep state whose only goal is self-preservation. To deal with this, Musk is able to go into the US Treasury or the Pentagon and look at who has been awarded government contracts. [But his own SpaceX company ](/news/world/americas/us-politics/elon-musk-spacex-contracts-doge-b2697271.html)has contracts worth billions from the US government. So too have his rivals. Is he really the man to judge what is fair government spending and what not? At the end of last week, the White House press secretary was asked who would police any conflict of interests arising from Musk’s own business interests and his work inside DOGE. Can you guess the answer? Why, of course, Musk will be left to police them himself. Does Donald Trump know what he has unleashed? Or take another hugely significant announcement of the past week – and I am not talking about [the return to plastic straws](/news/world/americas/us-politics/trump-plastic-straws-paper-explode-executive-order-b2695999.html) after the joke and scandal of paper ones. No, I’m talking about that minor foreign policy intervention over the future of [Gaza](/topic/gaza) and turning it into the [“Riviera of the Middle East”. ](/voices/starmer-donald-trump-gaza-palestine-b2692830.html) It probably takes quite a bit to leave Benjamin Netanyahu looking slack jawed, but the astonishment on his face as [Trump set out his plan for Gaza was quite something](/arts-entertainment/films/news/tilda-swinton-trump-gaza-takeover-riviera-b2698158.html). Did anyone in the administration know this was coming? It didn’t seem so. And yet Donald Trump had run with an idea that was entirely his son-in-law’s. Jared Kushner had floated it a few months ago. Like Trump, his background is real estate. And this could be the development of all developments. [Bulldoze Gaza, tell the 1.8 million Palestinians to bugger off somewhere else](/voices/gaza-uk-two-state-solution-trump-israel-keir-starmer-b2693373.html) and leave this prime sight to be redeveloped – from the riviera to the sea, anyone? To be generous, it looked like this – perhaps – hadn’t been completely thought through, or had the buy-in from the key stakeholders who would be needed to make this happen. And then we come to Ukraine, [where the great deal maker and negotiator](/news/world/americas/us-politics/donald-trump-ukraine-putin-russia-deal-b2697816.html) had apparently given [Russia more or less all that it wanted](/voices/trump-putin-starmer-russia-ukraine-b2697250.html) before discussions over the future of the country had even begun. Ukraine would have to give up land, and wouldn’t be allowed to join Nato. Vladimir will have had few better Valentine’s. In all three of these examples, Trump has been a defiant messenger – but it is not clear he’s delivering his own message. Musk, Kushner and [Putin](/topic/putin) all have reason to believe – with some justification – that they have played Donald rather well. In 2018, I attended the news conference held between [Trump and Putin ](/news/world/americas/us-politics/russia-g7-trump-putin-call-b2698235.html)in Helsinki. Putin gave Trump a football for his son Barron; and Trump gave Putin everything (again). He told reporters that he had taken the Russian president at his word that he hadn’t interfered in Trump’s 2016 election victory, contradicting the unanimous view of every US intelligence agency. The quote is variously attributed to David Lloyd George and the first world war general, field marshal Douglas Haig – but it is that ‘”he bears the impression of the last person who sat on him”. It is a notion that runs entirely counter to the image of strength and resolve that Trump likes to project. He wants to be seen as a tough guy –[ just like Putin ](/news/world/europe/ukraine-russia-war-chernobyl-trump-live-news-b2698249.html)– or Erdogan, Xi, Orban – but is he actually much more biddable – and too willing to let others around him influence policy? There is an argument others are making him look a fool. Which brings us back to X and his priceless cameo appearance in the Oval. Now off his father’s shoulders, he is fidgeting next to the Resolute Desk and Donald Trump’s face is turning ever more into a scowl. Above Musk’s voice [you can see the little chap looking at Trump ](/news/world/americas/us-politics/elon-musk-son-x-ae-a-xii-trump-white-house-b2696661.html)apparently saying: “You’re not the president.

79593647,How can I see the world in the most sustainable way?,"Simon Calder answers your questions on minimising your environmental impact, how to pay in Japan, the plans for Heathrow, and which airport is really the busiest","How can I see the world in the most sustainable way? [Simon Calder](/author/simon-calder) answers your questions on minimising your environmental impact, how to pay in Japan, the plans for Heathrow, and which airport is really the busiest [Comments] Q I want to travel as sustainably as possible but I still want to see distant places that involve flying. What choices would you recommend in terms of type of plane, airline and route? Sarah O’Neill A I fly more than average, and have two rules: always economy and minimal luggage. Flying a [business or first-class seat](/travel/news-and-advice/emirates-business-class-vs-economy-b2696689.html) around the world consumes several times more fuel than an economy seat. The more that travellers demand [premium seating](/travel/news-and-advice/emirates-business-class-singapore-melbourne-review-b2695829.html), the more that airlines will provide posh, heavy seats that are far less densely packed than economy. So don’t add to the demand. Flying humans around [is damaging enough](/travel/news-and-advice/heathrow-gatwick-luton-airport-expansion-b2683319.html) without also carting large amounts of their possessions. Travelling with cabin baggage only, weighing just a few kilograms, limits the damage and saves you money. Routes are also important. In general, “point-to-point” flights are significantly less damaging than connecting journeys: a substantial amount of fuel is used for each take-off, so in principle the fewer the better. You are also able to fly more directly. For example, a connecting flight from Manchester to Amsterdam to Madrid covers one-third more miles than the direct link to the Spanish capital. One exception to the “non-stop best” rule is the ultra-longhaul flight from London to Perth in Western Australia, covering over 9,000 miles. Because the Qantas Boeing 787 carries so much fuel for later in the journey, it burns much more than would be the case by adding a refuelling stop in Mumbai or Colombo, both close to the most direct route. If the distant places you have in mind are in eastern Australia (such as Sydney and Melbourne) or east Asia (Hong Kong, Shanghai or Tokyo), then the best way to limit your impact is to travel on one of the Chinese airlines that are allowed to overfly Russia. The fuel burn is at least 10 per cent less than that of the European carriers, which are obliged to take much longer flight paths to avoid the world’s biggest country. You change planes in China for your final destination. Finally, the newer the plane, the more efficient it will be. Choose airlines with relatively modern fleets, such as Pegasus of Turkey, Play of Iceland, and Wizz Air of Hungary. And steer clear of Delta, which has some extraordinarily old Boeing 757s and 767s. They are perfectly safe, but unfashionably thirsty. Q We’re going on an escorted tour of Japan at the beginning of May. The Foreign Office website says that credit cards are not usually accepted as Japan is still a cash-based society. We normally take very little cash with us, relying instead on a Halifax Clarity card. Can you please clarify this for us? Brenda S-J A Large parts of the world are now financially navigable solely using plastic or smartphones. I have just returned from a trip taking in [Dubai](/topic/dubai), Singapore and three Australian states: only once was real money expected, for a bus ride in Hobart, Tasmania. Conversely, though, some locations that you might expect to be highly advanced in terms of non-cash payment systems are way behind. For example in Seoul, South Korea, ticket machines for the extensive subway system accept only cash. In Japan, the picture for payment in yen is mixed: in Tokyo and other cities with lots of tourists, card acceptance is widespread – particularly in more upmarket venues. But local cafes and restaurants of the kind that most travellers adore, as well as markets, are largely cash-only. As you are on an escorted tour, presumably with most meals provided, you will not need to take too much cash. The tour operator is likely to recommend an amount that, in my observation, may well prove too much. For a two-week trip you might want to take about £200 (roughly £14 per day) and, if necessary, top up from an ATM along the way. Coming back with surplus yen is unhelpful. As you have a Halifax Clarity card, any card purchases you make will be fee-free; I use one solely for spending abroad. But as anywhere, beware of “dynamic currency conversion” – where you are offered the chance to pay in sterling rather than yen. The one guarantee is that the exchange rate will be unfavourable. Always pay in local currency. Q On [Heathrow airport](/topic/heathrow-airport) expansion: this new nomenclature all looks rather confusing. Why don’t they just rename Terminal 5 as Terminal 1, since Terminal 1 has been scrapped? Kristian G A The context for your question: London Heathrow is planning to expand over the next decade or so. If expansion survives the legal process, adding a third runway will allow traffic – and passenger numbers – to increase by up to 54 per cent. So lots of extra terminal space will be needed. While Heathrow will not be drawn on details, a 2019 consultation document gives clues as to how the extra capacity could be created. Terminal 2, at the eastern end of the airfield, currently comprises a main building (T2A) and a satellite (T2B). A second satellite, T2C, is planned to the east, with another (T2D) to the west. These extra facilities would replace Terminal 3, which will be demolished. Meanwhile at Terminal 5 – used by British Airways – the most distant of the existing satellites, T5C, will be extended to create more gates. Another terminal, T5X, will be built to the west behind the existing Terminal 5. It will eventually be connected to yet another terminal, called T5X North. Why have an airport with three terminals numbered 2, 4 and 5 rather than the more obvious 1, 2 and 3? Partly because each terminal has its own strong identity in the minds of regular travellers. Terminal 2 is the smart new home for all the Star Alliance airlines; T5 is the British Airways base; and Terminal 4 is the odd one on the edge. Also, the scope for confusion, among staff as well as passengers, from renaming a terminal is substantial. There is a parallel on the railways: if a station is extended with an extra platform beside platforms 1, 2, etc, as has happened at London King’s Cross, Cardiff Central and Doncaster, it is named platform 0. That may look a bit daft, but people get used to the idea, and it is easier than shuffling everything along by one. To go back to your original question. The big additions to Terminal 5 – T5X and T5X North – could theoretically be combined together as a new Terminal 1, but I gather Heathrow wants everything at the western end of the airport to be T5 branded. Q I’ve just read your latest feature about travel in the UAE. I thought Atlanta was the busiest airport, not Dubai? Martin G A Two questions about mega-airports in successive days. Yesterday it was all about the terminals at a perhaps-soon-to-be-expanded London Heathrow. Today it’s about scale, and how the world’s biggest hubs shape up. London Heathrow used to call itself “the world’s busiest international airport”, when what it actually meant was “we have more international passengers than anyone else”. But since 2014, it has been overtaken by Dubai anyway. The exact words I wrote were: “A decade ago, Dubai took Heathrow’s title as the world’s biggest hub for international passengers.” The key word there is “international”. Atlanta Hartsfield airport is the clear global winner in terms of both passenger numbers (approaching 110 million last year) and flight movements, with Dubai well behind in second place. But the Georgia hub is mainly concerned with domestic connections, and in particular linking the big east-coast cities with the rest of the US. Yes, Atlanta has international flights – mainly serving Latin America and Canada – but far fewer than the big European and Gulf hubs. According to the latest figures, only around one in eight passengers using Atlanta was flying internationally. Heathrow more or less reverses that, with just one in eight of its 83.9 million annual travellers taking domestic flights. At Dubai, 100 per cent of the 93.4 million passengers handled last year were international; there are no domestic links. In terms of revenue, international passengers are generally more valuable than domestic travellers. At an airport like Dubai, passengers are typically flying many thousands of miles and paying handsomely for the privilege. They are also carrying (or rather checking in) far more luggage than US domestic travellers. And the wide-bodied aircraft used are flying lots of cargo around. So if you expand the concept of “busy” beyond simple passenger numbers, Dubai and Heathrow have more activity than Atlanta. Certainly they feel much busier. To round off the picture worldwide: Dallas-Fort Worth and Heathrow are neck-and-neck for third place in terms of passenger numbers. In fifth is Tokyo Haneda, with Istanbul challenging. The biggest continental rival to Heathrow, Paris CDG, is fairly well down the table in 11th place.

That New York lilt. That round, honeyed purr, like a cat with plans. Try it yourself. Go on. Speak from the back of your throat. Elongate those vowels. What you shouldn’t do, though, is try it in front of him. “People come up to me in the street and they impersonate me to my face,” Walken says. “You know, they speak the way I speak.” The actor, 81 and spry, looks knowingly down the lens of his Zoom camera. “And I’m never sure what they’re doing at first. I think, ‘Why is he talking that way?’ But then I realise.” He lets out an ambivalent whine. This sounds a little cruel, I tell him, while fully aware that I was speaking pure Walkenese to a colleague mere minutes before our interview. “Oh, it happens all the time,” he sighs. Put aside the invasiveness, though, and I suppose it’s a compliment. Abstruse, eerie, often impossible to pin down, Walken has existed outside of regular ol’ superstardom for decades now – today he’s, what, myth? A voice to be emulated. An image in a rap lyric. A dancer in a Fatboy Slim video. On-screen, he can be cool, psychotic, slippery, wise. An offbeat talker; a light mover. He’s [played an emperor in Dune](/arts-entertainment/films/reviews/dune-2-review-zendaya-timothee-chalamet-b2502390.html), an ant in Antz, and murderers in many things.

But then few are Christopher Walken. Except for on TV. Where, [up until very recently](/arts-entertainment/tv/features/severance-season-2-release-date-time-cast-apple-tv-b2681253.html), there were two. In Severance, the Apple TV+ Rubik’s cube that’s currently in the midst of its [second, head-spinning season](/arts-entertainment/tv/reviews/severance-season-2-review-adam-scott-apple-tv-b2680907.html), employees of a mysterious biotech company have their lives split in half: one side of themselves exists in the world as we know it, with families, loved ones and hobbies; the other exists only within the walls of the workplace. Ne’er the twain shall meet – or even remember anything from the other’s space. But for ostensibly platonic colleagues Burt and Irving (played with such sweet, mature longing by Walken and John Turturro, both of whom received Emmy nominations for their work in 2022), something ambiguous hangs between them – either a romantic attraction that already exists on the outside, or something they want to make real on the inside. “John and I – we’re not unlike a married couple in real life,” Walken laughs. The pair have known each other for close to four decades, first meeting at a party for the Yale Drama School sometime in the early Eighties (Turturro had just graduated; Walken was passing through). They’ve worked on films together, too – usually scrappy little comedies such as 1995’s Search and Destroy or The Jesus Rolls, Turturro’s [strange quasi-sequel to The Big Lebowski](/arts-entertainment/films/reviews/the-jesus-rolls-review-big-lebowski-john-turturro-coen-brothers-cast-director-a9407096.html) from 2019. But even though Severance often keeps them apart – Burt retired at the end of season one, meaning his two lives have been reduced to one – it’s the most they’ve worked together so far. “We’ve had our ups and downs together,” Walken continues. “And when you can finish off each other’s sentences or laugh at each other’s jokes, it counts for a lot when you’re playing parts like these.” He smiles. “You can tell when people like each other.” Walken is talking to me from New York, dressed in a black blazer and navy shirt, his hair grey, coiffed and tall, like he’s been electrocuted. We’re speaking before Christmas, our conversation taking place more or less with an Apple-branded dart blaster aimed at us: I’ve seen five episodes of the long-in-the-works second season at this point but have been forbidden to talk about their specifics. Today, viewers will know that Burt has been largely absent since the show’s return, existing solely in the real world following his retirement. Irving, meanwhile, has been left heartbroken in the wake of discovering that Burt’s “outie” – as opposed to his workplace “innie” – is married to a man who isn’t him. They’ve been kept apart until this week’s episode, which saw the pair finally meeting in the real world and Burt inviting Irving to eat dinner with him and his husband (a cryptic John Noble). It was a lovely reunion, albeit with strings attached. Their scenes remain some of the show’s best: tender, romantic, unexpectedly, well, erotic. “It’s been different for me,” Walken says. “Usually I’m up to no good in movies, but now I’m playing a nice, romantic person.” And gay, which is a first. Not that it’s a big deal, he says. “The truth is that I don’t really make a distinction there. Straight? Gay? That’s never been very interesting to me. People love each other.” He shrugs. It’s the “nice” part that he finds most surprising. “Because it’s much more up my alley than all those other parts I’ve played,” he says. Meaning the psychopaths. Remember when he pushed Michelle Pfeiffer out of a high-rise window in Batman Returns, or played the Headless Horseman in Sleepy Hollow? And that’s just two of many. “Oh, it started way back,” he laughs. “One of the first things I did was Annie Hall, where I played this guy who wants to drive into traffic. Then I made The Deer Hunter, where I shot myself in the head. And then I just got identified with, you know, people who are troubled… to say the least.” Deeply unlike him, he insists. “The facts of my life are that I’ve been married for over 50 years, I pay my bills, and I live in a house. I’m a very normal person.” He doesn’t even get upset very often. Especially when he’s on set. “It’s rare to work with someone you don’t like,” he explains. “It’s happened once or twice, but it’s rare. Actors tend to get along. We’re like a tribe, a family. Every once in a while there’s somebody you’d like to push down the stairs, but…” Now there’s a bit of classic Walken villainy, I tell him. “I swear it’s only ever a passing thought.” Watch Apple TV+ free for 7 days New subscribers only. £8.99/mo. after free trial.

Not because he’s got walls up, but because no one else is really like him – he’s otherworldly, surprising, a little mystical. Sean Penn once remarked that attempting to define Christopher Walken is akin to “trying to define a cloud”. And the privacy only adds to that. He’s been a pop culture staple since the Seventies, but he retains a degree of mystery. Did you know that his name’s not even Christopher? “It’s a Severance kind of thing,” he laughs. “I’m Christopher, but to a small group of people, I’m Ronnie.” Those people include his closest friends and his wife, the former casting director Georgianne Walken, whom he married in 1969. The enigmatic Ronald Walken was born in Queens, New York, to a mother and father who’d emigrated from Scotland and Germany, respectively. The facts of his biography are often so wild that they sound made up. But Walken was a child actor from the age of five, did run away to join the circus, did tame lions, and was advised to make Christopher his stage name by a nightclub dancer in the early Sixties. Theatre beckoned soon after, followed by a run of film hits in the Seventies: he played an artistic lothario in the comedy Next Stop, Greenwich Village; Diane Keaton’s unhinged brother in Annie Hall; the tragic Vietnam veteran of The Deer Hunter, for which he won a Best Supporting Actor Oscar in 1979. The latter propelled him to leading man status. He is marvellously haunted in the 1983 Stephen King adaptation The Dead Zone, as a schoolteacher struck by premonitions of the future, and a vision of paternal cruelty in the crime thriller At Close Range, released in 1986. Some of the greatest Walken roles, though, are the supporting gigs or tiny cameos that rapidly became his bread and butter: the sleazy record exec in Wayne’s World 2, a sinister nightcrawler in Abel Ferrara’s vampire tale The Addiction, the cranky exterminator in Mousehunt. There’s a real softness to him at times, too. Look at Steven Spielberg’s Catch Me If You Can. Come for Walken as the slick, deceptive father to Leonardo DiCaprio’s fledgling conman, stay for the panicked vulnerability he lets peer out as the film goes on. “My favourite part of being an actor, really, is the time I spend by myself, learning the scripts, studying them, learning lines,” he says. “It takes me for ever to learn lines, so to stand in my kitchen with the script is kind of as good as it gets.” Unlike Burt in Severance, Walken’s not tempted by retirement himself. “Acting is all I do,” he says. “If I stop, what would I do? There are people who play golf, who write books. They travel, have kids and grandkids. I don’t have any of that, so I go to work. But when you look at the history of movies and theatre, very few actors ever say they’re done.” I tell him I can only think of Sean Connery who officially retired, packing it all in after a bad experience on a film. “But he was a big golfer,” Walken says. “So he had something to do.” He taps his chin, thinking. “I don’t play golf.” Directors sometimes retire, he adds. “Quentin said somewhere that he wasn’t going to make any more movies, but I hope that’s not true.” He’s talking about Tarantino, who [pledged a few years ago to make just one more film](/arts-entertainment/films/features/quentin-tarantino-movie-critic-final-film-retired-b2530802.html) – bringing his filmography to a total of 10 movies – before throwing in the towel. The pair go back a while, Walken reciting two of Tarantino’s [most famous monologues on screen](/arts-entertainment/films/news/quentin-tarantino-movies-best-characters-b2301207.html), first the speech about the Sicilian mafia in True Romance – which culminates in Walken blowing Dennis Hopper’s brains out – then the ludicrous, scatological backstory of a military man’s gold watch in Pulp Fiction. There’s an old quote from Tarantino, from around the time of True Romance, where he said he felt “embarrassed” that Walken had spent months fastidiously learning his lines until they were note perfect. “It was almost intimidating that such a terrific actor would take my work so seriously,” he said. Walken remembers doing much the same for his Pulp Fiction role. “I had the speech for about four months, and I think it was eight pages long,” he says. “And no matter what else I was doing, I would spend an hour a day going over that speech and gradually learning it. And every time I got to the end of it, it would make me laugh. Because his dialogue is all there on the page.” They were introduced by a mutual friend, the actor Harvey Keitel. “I was staying at the Chateau Marmont at the time, and Harvey said to me, ‘There’s this guy you’ve got to meet, he’s brilliant,’ and he brought Quentin over. And I remember he was kind of shy and he looked about 12.” Walken hoots. “And I thought, you know, Harvey had discovered this Orson Wellesian teenager. Anyway, he’s terrific.” He’s always had an eye for young talent. He bonded with Penn while filming At Close Range in 1985, and then his girlfriend at the time, a pop star supernova named Madonna. “I spent a lot of time with her because she’d be on the set, and I liked her very much,” he says. Soon after, he attended the pair’s nuptials. “It’s the only wedding I’ve ever been to where people were jumping out of bushes with cameras and there were helicopters flying overhead,” he laughs. “It was also the noisiest wedding I’ve ever been to.” Years later, and long after she and Penn had split, Madonna called Walken up asking him to [appear in one of her music videos](/arts-entertainment/films/features/madonna-david-fincher-bad-girl-music-video-vogue-mank-netflix-b1616824.html). She had the perfect part for him to play. “It was the Angel of Death,” Walken smiles, wry and spooky. “Because who else?” ‘Severance’ is streaming on Apple TV+, with new episodes released every Friday Join our commenting forum Join thought-provoking conversations, follow other Independent readers and see their replies [Comments]",independent.co.uk,https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/tv/features/christopher-walken-severance-interview-b2698388.html,[],"['Christopher Walken', 'Severance']",2025-02-14,2025-02-14,0,2,102,161,14397

The topics that pit generation against generation can be even sillier – does the [length of your socks](/life-style/socks-gen-z-millenial-trends-b2557341.html) really signify anything? Does whether or not you send Christmas cards to everyone you’ve ever met, still have a landline, or choose to upload your musings to Facebook or TikTok really define who you are as a person? But there are some genuine lines in the sand that are hard to ignore, the latest one being [space](/topic/space). It’s in short supply – and some demographics are more equal than others when it comes to staking their claim. According to new data, b[aby boomer](/topic/baby-boomer) [homeowners](/topic/homeowners) are enjoying ever more breathing space with bedrooms to spare, while [Gen Z](/topic/gen-z) are being squeezed into increasingly small and expensive rental properties. The latest [English Housing Survey](https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/english-housing-survey#full-publication-update-history) reveals that 55.7 per cent of owner-occupied homes in England, equating to just under 10 million, are classified as “under-occupied”, with at least two unused bedrooms. This number has risen by more than 10 per cent over the last 20 years. But the story of the [rental market](/topic/rental-market) is very different – just 13 per cent of properties are under-occupied, down 3 per cent from the previous year. The age group most likely to reap the rewards of all this room is pensioners: more than a third (36 per cent) of Britain’s homes are owned by this cohort. In the most recent census, [84.1 per cent of households](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/money/property/baby-boomers-not-downsizing-holding-on-large-homes/) where an over-65-year-old was the main resident were under-occupied. Conversely, the number of young people with no housing wealth at all – 44 per cent of 25 to 34-year-olds – is at a record high, according to Intergenerational Foundation analysis of ONS data shared with [The Daily Telegraph](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/money/property/buying-selling/how-baby-boomers-fuelling-housing-crisis/). The average age of a first-time buyer in England has [now risen to 34](/news/uk/itv-debate-labour-english-office-for-national-statistics-england-b2557202.html). And if you’re one of those under 34-year-olds currently grappling with the, at times, [completely unhinged rental market](/life-style/flat-rent-lodger-out-away-weekends-b2681629.html) in this country? You are likely to be living in increasingly cramped conditions – put aside the number of bedrooms and the total amount of physical floor space is reducing. Nearly one in five properties for rent have less than 50 square metres of floor space, the minimum required by law for two occupants. The percentage of dwellings smaller than this has grown from 15.3 per cent a decade ago to 18.6 per cent today. Beneath all these numbers, percentages and statistics are the real people affected by the big squeeze. It’s hard to argue against the sense of injustice that young people feel when their circumstances are contrasted with a generation who seem to have won the lottery of life: more rooms than they know what to do with; household wealth [33 times that of 16-24-year-olds](https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/personalandhouseholdfinances/incomeandwealth/bulletins/totalwealthingreatbritain/april2020tomarch2022); and who, according to previous analysis, are helping fuel the current housing shortage by [refusing to downsize](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/money/property/baby-boomers-not-downsizing-holding-on-large-homes/) when their children have flown the nest. Households aged 65 to 74 are, in fact, [getting richer at the fastest rate](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/2025/01/25/boomers-33-times-wealthy-gen-z-gettin-richer/) of any generation. But back to space. It can be something of an abstract concept – the kind of thing that you barely notice when you have enough of it, but whose absence is profoundly felt and impossible to ignore. The Covid pandemic shone a light on this discrepancy like nothing else, splitting the population into the haves and the have-nots – a divide less to do with disposable income and more to do with the tolerability of your living situation. Baby boomers safely ensconced in four-bedroom detached houses in the countryside with rambling gardens and acres of green space on the doorstep wondered what the fuss was all about when we entered lockdowns, chastising everyone else to just “keep calm and carry on”. Those of us trapped in one-bedroom flats without so much as a balcony, at the whims of landlords who could up the rent at a moment’s notice, had a markedly different experience. I still remember, at the tail-end of restrictions, [searching for a room in London](/life-style/renting-london-spareroom-lodger-mortgage-rates-b2684344.html) after breaking up with my long-term partner. Competition among renters was particularly fierce at a time when many people’s circumstances had changed, with anything half-decent or reasonably priced snapped up within days. The low point came when I was shown a “six-bedroom” flat, sold on the flexibility of its rolling monthly contract (meaning I could leave – and therefore get kicked out – at a moment’s notice. How exciting!). The other catch quickly became apparent: there was no longer a living room, the private landlords having chosen instead to convert this into the sixth bedroom to maximise profits. The only “communal” space left was the kitchen, so small there wasn’t room for a table. The “bedroom” would therefore have to serve as lounge, dining room and office when working from home, all rolled into one minuscule and deeply depressing package. It was difficult, at the time, not to feel resentment towards the older people I knew who would attend Zoom events from their spacious home office or jump on a call from their sun-dappled gardens, answering emails while getting a tan. “The continued widening of the gulf of housing wealth between generations is deeply concerning,” Toby Whelton, from the Intergenerational Foundation, said of the think tank’s latest analysis. “If these trends of low homeownership continue for younger generations, it will mean that when younger generations reach state pension age, the majority will not enjoy the same security of owning their own home and will be forced into renting into very old age.” It’s hard to see how the tide might turn. In November last year, the [average UK house price was £290,000](https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/uk-house-price-index-for-november-2024/uk-house-price-index-summary-november-2024) – 10 times the average salary for a 22 to 29-year-old. Thirty-five years ago, baby boomers could pick up a house for around five times the average salary. Their money went twice as far. Nothing about that is fair. No, it’s not baby boomers’ fault that they benefited from growing up in a completely different economic landscape. No, pitting old against young does nothing to bring us together as a nation following a turbulent few decades of austerity, Brexit, coronavirus and all the rest. But Britain’s young people have good reason to be mad as hell. We may indeed have “more in common”, but wouldn’t it be nice to live in a world where one of the things we all had in common was access to affordable housing?

Soon, thanks to AI, we may not work at all As top firms fret over how to manage the demand to work from home, [Chris Blackhurst](/author/chris-blackhurst) looks at how AI might blow up the working world altogether [Comments] The world of work is in a state of flux. [JP Morgan](/topic/jp-morgan) is ordering its staff back into the office five days a week, resulting in a hunt for extra space to accommodate the 14,000 desks needed at its London Canary Wharf headquarters. Amazon has taken the same line. Meta, Starbucks and Dell are [also moving against remote working and WFH](/life-style/starbucks-ceo-remote-work-seattle-brian-niccol-b2598753.html). But [Citigroup](/topic/citigroup) has said most of its employees can work remotely two days a week, and is [refitting its £1bn Canary Wharf building](/voices/jp-morgan-working-from-home-wfh-hybrid-flexible-b2676541.html). Meanwhile, 12 Labour MPs (and one Green) are pressing for an amendment to the Employment Rights Bill, currently wending its way through parliament, for a [four-day week](/topic/four-day-week) to become law. At the same time, the universal basic income (UBI) movement is gaining traction; this is the idea of a no-strings-attached payment made regularly to everyone in society. Trials are taking place all over the globe, including in Ireland and Scotland. A pilot will soon be launched, in Jarrow and Finchley, that will see people receive £1600 a month for doing precisely nothing. The effect it has on their health and wellbeing, and whether they choose to do additional work, will be monitored. UBI is not new: the concept has been mooted since Thomas More wrote [Utopia](/topic/utopia) in 1516. It’s being given a modern dusting as a possible solution to the advance of [AI](/topic/ai). Among its leading proponents is Andy Burnham. The mayor of Greater Manchester argues it could serve as an antidote to technology’s onslaught and, by improving people’s lives, could save the government money by reducing social harm. Indeed, one trial showed that recipients were more likely to develop startup businesses and less likely to get divorced. This week, delegates at the Paris AI summit met against a backdrop of predictions that the technology will surpass human capabilities “in almost everything” within two to three years. Already, it’s estimated that, in the first year of ChatGPT, 14 per cent of Americans lost their jobs to robots. Elon Musk is saying the biggest threat to AI will come not from what it can do, but from governments reeling at the effects of wholesale unemployment. That does not stop him from also sharing that, in the future, a job will be for “personal satisfaction”. Goldman Sachs reckons as many as 300 million posts will disappear. This is the same Goldman Sachs that has abandoned its own hybrid attendance policy implemented during the pandemic and issued a full return-to-office mandate. It’s also in an area – banking – that is in the crosshairs of AI. Previously, it was supposed that dirty or physical jobs were at most risk from tech; now it’s thought the target is the middle-class professions of law, medicine, and banking and finance. We’re clearly stuck at a crossroads, uncertain of the route forward. How long we will be here remains to be seen. There are benefits and flaws with the different propositions. WFH is thought to be better for work-life balance; it improves mental health, removes the stress of commuting (as well as saving the time wasted in transit), and staff are said to work more efficiently. Employers are able to save money by not requiring such large premises. That’s the view, although the evidence is apocryphal and not scientific. Against that, critics maintain that WFH encourages shirking, reduces spontaneity and creativity, and increases a sense of isolation, reducing opportunities for collegiality and mentoring. Similarly, all circumstantial. A four-day week has similar benefits and drawbacks. On the downside, it’s enshrining in statute the notion of a slower fifth day that exists in many workplaces anyway, and what it will achieve is to make Thursday, not Friday, that more relaxed day. Quite how shorter hours will secure greater economic growth – a requisite of this government – those Labour supporters have yet to explain. They prefer to dwell on how it’s needed because AI will reduce employment. But if true, it’s hard to see how four days will be any more of a safeguard than five. That’s where UBI comes in and says “To hell with it, here’s some cash to help compensate for the lot – you no longer need to work.” But what should be its value? What is enough in the northeast of England may not be anything like enough in north London. And who will pay for it? While some will enjoy UBI, there must still be sufficient numbers in paid employment, paying the taxes that will fund it. To say that governments, employers, do not know where to turn is an understatement. They sense change is coming; it’s not here yet. But they’re not sure what form it will take, or how extensive it will be. Some are focusing on the present, weighing which working patterns they believe to be right. Nothing is certain. The future of employment is occupying a similar space to climate change: something is happening, but we’ve got little idea of what the effects will be, or whether it will be slow and incremental or advance in a rush. That equates to frustration. All the folk who gather at events such as Emmanuel Macron’s AI fest, with their smart software and algorithms, and like to forecast yesterday what will occur tomorrow, are nowhere near agreement. The result is fragmentation: practices adopted here and not there; policies enthusiastically supported and equally scorned. Utopia also advocated a ban on private property; goods being stored in warehouses, with people requesting what they need; no locks on the doors of houses; and citizens switching homes every 10 years. Every person on More’s fictional island had to learn an essential trade, and they wore similar, simple clothes. They were each paid the same, but they were all expected to work. There were free hospitals, and meals were eaten in community dining halls. What he was satirising writ large was monastic life, in which everyone lived happily. Utopia or dystopia? If anyone has the answer, we’re ready to hear it.

However, being a writer and artist of [graphic novels](/topic/graphic-novels), I find myself obliged to choose one in order to champion the form in general – it’s Art Spiegelman’s Maus. Dealing with the harrowing wartime experiences of his father, Vladek, a Polish Jew and survivor of Auschwitz, and Spiegelman’s troubled relationship with him; it’s [biography](/topic/biography), [autobiography](/topic/autobiography) and historical [memoir](/topic/memoir), told in the comics medium. Not wanting to trivialise Vladek’s story by employing an overtly dramatic style, Spiegelman presents it in a straightforward cartoon way, with Jews represented as mice (the rodent metaphor taken straight from Hitler’s own propaganda) and Nazis as cats. As with Hergé’s ligne claire depictions of Tintin, the simple mouse masks make it easy for readers to empathise with the protagonists. Along with the eloquent visual storytelling, they make the [book](/topic/book) easily accessible to non-comics readers. The cartoon style and anthropomorphic characters allow the reader to approach otherwise horrific situations in a direct way, without the use of realistically explicit images and melodrama, while still retaining the power of the experience. The style is deceptively simple. Spiegelman experimented with different approaches and each page underwent multiple stages as he strove for clarity and fluidity. He tells the story dispassionately and honestly without any knowing winks to comics-literate readers. Nor is he trying to tell a “worthy” story, but simply documenting his father’s wartime experiences and depicting how he elicited this information. The present-day sequences give us an unsentimental portrait of this survivor of the death camp. Spiegelman doesn’t glamorise his father as some kind of hero. Vladek comes across as irritating, manipulative, exasperating, and even bigoted. One wouldn’t expect humour, but it’s there, often wry and situational. It’s a rich, well-rounded book. The first comic book to win a Pulitzer Prize, Maus paved the way in English-speaking countries for the recognition of the comic medium as a legitimate art form and for graphic [novels](/topic/novels) that deal with “serious” issues. It’s fashionable to say that articles promoting the graphic novel as an art are redundant because this is now a truth universally acknowledged. It’s not. There’s still a tremendous amount of prejudice against the form that’s in dire need of redress. Never read a GN? Why not try Maus?

And some people need more help than others. For [every Tony Blair ](/independentpremium/voices/tony-blair-immigration-national-archives-b2672052.html)and Boris Johnson, shovelling charm and charisma in spades, there is a John Major[ or Keir Starmer](/voices/trump-putin-starmer-russia-ukraine-b2697250.html), whose presentation skills feel more PowerPoint than powerful. This is where the experts come in. Recently, it was revealed that Starmer had sought the help of former Royal Shakespeare Company actress Leonie Mellinger. And, of course, one of the most famous political transformations of all time was that of [Margaret Thatcher](/topic/margaret-thatcher), who made it her mission to change her voice – once deemed too harsh to be included in a party-political broadcast. While her metamorphosis into the polished Iron Lady who stood on the steps of No 10 looking and sounding like a leader is well known, how she got there has long been shrouded in mystery – especially the role played by one of Britain’s greatest actors. In her early days in the Commons, Thatcher was shrill, awkward, and unprepossessing. As an ambitious education secretary, she knew she had a problem and wanted to do something about it. Of course, all senior politicians want the public to believe that what they see is what they get, but in the television age, that is seldom, if ever, possible. Thatcher and her inner circle were, however, far better at keeping the secret than Starmer’s team. It is only relatively recently that the full debt Thatcher owed to her own illustrious [acting](/topic/acting) coach – [Laurence Olivier](/topic/laurence-olivier) – has become clear. During the 1979 general election campaign, the change in her tone and comportment was noticeable. When the canny BBC political journalist Michael Cockerell caught up with Thatcher and asked her directly why her voice had become so much softer, she didn’t dispute that it had changed but, after a pause, said she could not explain it herself. It was only in 2012 – a year before Thatcher’s death – that the truth began to slowly emerge. The family of the late Kate Fleming, a famous voice coach at the National Theatre, released her private papers to the institution, which included invoices for work she had undertaken for the Conservative Party between 1972 and 1976. Thatcher’s name was discreetly unmentioned, but the invoices covered her time as education secretary under Edward Heath, up to and just beyond her accession as party leader in 1975. Thatcher loyalists explained the invoices away, saying Fleming had come to work for her after Gordon Reece – Thatcher’s image guru, who officially started working for her in 1978 as her director of publicity – had bumped into Laurence Olivier by chance on a train to Brighton. Reece had supposedly confided in Olivier – on their very first meeting, no less – that he was concerned Thatcher was coming across badly. Olivier then allegedly suggested she see Fleming, the woman who had helped him find the deep octaves he needed as Othello. Wanting to preserve Thatcher’s image as an ordinary “housewife”, those close to her were reluctant to admit that Olivier and Thatcher had ever actually met. But this changed after Tim Bell, another of Thatcher’s image consultants, gave an interview shortly before his death in 2019, in which he finally admitted that Olivier, a lifelong Conservative, and Thatcher had indeed had a meeting. Even decades after Thatcher left office, attempts were made to downplay Olivier’s role. Some claimed that all Olivier had done when they met was drone on about his own career, boring Thatcher rigid. In another version, it was Thatcher who had bored Olivier. Clearly, both stories strain credulity: these two strong personalities, leading such interesting lives, would unquestionably have found each other fascinating. I first heard the tale of Thatcher and Olivier working together around the turn of the millennium and was immediately intrigued. The late playwright Ronald Harwood – a close friend of Reece, as well as Thatcher’s speechwriter Ronald Millar – told me the pair had met not just once but multiple times. He also spelled out exactly why she had seen him: for acting classes. These lessons covered not just her voice but essentially the creation of the role she was to play – from her deportment to her wardrobe. Made up and costumed, she became a force to be reckoned with. Certainly, when anyone looks at footage of the pre-Olivier Thatcher and the post-Olivier Thatcher, there is no question that Cockerell’s early suspicions on the campaign trail were more than justified. Olivier, a very traditional “from-the-outside-in” actor known for his emphatic style, had plainly done a bit of a number on her. Her whole demeanour – from her hair to her handbag – is unmistakably theatrical. I couldn’t stop imagining how this duo had worked together, and this became the inspiration for my play When Maggie Met Larry, which is being broadcast on Radio 4 to mark the 50th anniversary of her becoming leader of the Conservative Party. The joy of drama is that you can give your imagination free rein – and at one point, I even have Olivier lying physically on top of the future prime minister. Olivier was, in real life, a terrible flirt, and that, of course, adds a particular frisson to the proceedings. The play also brings out all the contrasts between these larger-than-life characters: the prudish, once-married Thatcher and the louche, thrice-married Olivier. Then there were the starkly different worlds they inhabited and the additional twist that, when they met, Olivier was in the twilight years of his career, while she was at the dawn of hers. Naturally, I asked Harwood why he didn’t write a play about it himself. He replied wearily that Reece had told him the story in confidence, and he was himself a loyal Tory. Harwood said that I could do whatever I wanted with the story, but only when all those involved – including himself – were dead and buried. That is how, after my old friend passed away in 2020, I came to tentatively run the idea by a few people and begin working on my drama. Clearly, everything hinged on getting the right actors to play Thatcher and Olivier. For the former, the bar is especially high. Patricia Hodge emphasised Thatcher’s sensual side in The Falklands Play; Meryl Streep made her seem bossy and arch in The Iron Lady; Janet Brown played her for laughs in the James Bond film For Your Eyes Only. Lesley Manville, Andrea Riseborough, and Lindsay Duncan have all had a go at walking in her patent leather heels, and most recently, Harriet Walter captured Thatcher’s vulnerable side in James Graham’s Brian and Maggie. Since this was radio, all that mattered was getting an actor who could communicate Thatcher’s personality through her voice. With no need for a physical resemblance, Frances Barber – one of the most beloved and respected names in the business – proved to be an inspired choice. Despite her vocal left-wing views, she quickly inhabited Thatcher’s persona and now admits that the experience has made her more understanding of the often-divisive politician, particularly in terms of her own insecurities as someone in the limelight. Just as the real Thatcher needed help with her voice, Frances had her own voice coach in Steve Nallon, the man who gave the Tory leader her voice on Spitting Image. As a protege and friend of Olivier, Derek Jacobi, meanwhile, brings special gravitas to the role of her acting coach. Ever the perfectionist, he wanted to run through the script over several days at his home in north London before we recorded the play over two days at a studio on an industrial estate in Acton last summer. Under the deft direction of Richard Clifford, Derek brilliantly communicates Olivier’s love of acting, his insecurities, and his wicked sense of humour. So what does Frances’s Thatcher bring that hasn’t been done before? I am biased, of course, but I would say she takes our understanding of Thatcher to a whole new level – that the former prime minister was ultimately a theatrical creation. And 50 years on, her performance on the world stage has not been forgotten. ‘When Maggie Met Larry’ airs on Radio 4 at 3pm on 15 February and will be available on BBC Sounds Join our commenting forum Join thought-provoking conversations, follow other Independent readers and see their replies [Comments]",independent.co.uk,https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/tv/features/margaret-thatcher-acting-laurence-olivier-b2698371.html,[],"['Acting', 'Laurence Olivier', 'Margaret Thatcher', 'Prime Ministers']",2025-02-14,2025-02-14,0,4,63,262,8953

Few have [captured the emotions of many](/news/world/middle-east/trump-gaza-mad-man-theory-b2692783.html), more than the words of a British official, who said it had gone down “like a bowl of cold sick”. Certainly, this week’s pronouncements by Trump and his acolyte Pete Hegseth, the former Fox News anchor who is now the US secretary of defence, have generated anger and despair in [Ukraine](/topic/ukraine) and among its supporters. But, they have also confirmed, with perfect clarity, what has been clear to European members of Nato and Canada since Trump returned to the White House: America, for 80 years since the end of the Second World War, the guarantor of European security, can no longer be trusted as an ally. European Nato members have, in many ways, created the conditions for America’s abdication of leadership of the “free world” by their willingness to freeload off American largesse. They must now look to themselves and look after their own, and Ukraine’s security. As General Slim said when commanding troops in Burma in the face of the Japanese invasion in 1942: “God helps those who help themselves.” It is not without irony that America’s craven appeasement of Putin comes at the start of the Munich Security Conference, a repeat of Britain and France’s betrayal of Czechoslovakia in Munich in 1938. A preening Trump may claim he is the master of the deal, but in conceding Ukrainian territorial sovereignty and Nato membership over the heads of the Ukrainians and Europe, he has, at a stroke, strengthened Putin and demonstrated his weakness. We should not be surprised. It was Trump who set up the 2021 collapse of Nato’s mission in Afghanistan with his deal with the Taliban in 2020, from which the Afghan government was also excluded. Hegseth, too, has played into Russian hands by excluding American troops from any peacekeeping enforcement effort, stating that any European force would have to operate without the ultimate security guarantee of Article 5 of the Washington Treaty. So how should we in Europe, together with Canada, respond? First, we must recognise [Russia](/topic/russia) for what it is, rather than what we would like it to be. Whatever its cultural virtues, it is a cruel, vindictive and murderous state that has only ever been an empire. Imperialism is woven into its DNA; Russia’s story is one of expansion, of taking over neighbouring states, forcing them into colonial submission until it overreaches itself and contracts, and starts again. Integral to this, is the notion that Ukraine has no right to exist as a sovereign state and that Russia can never be the country it has a right to be if Ukraine is independent. Make no mistake, Russia will not stop at Ukraine and Trump has, by his words, paved the way. Single-handedly he has created the conditions for Putin to achieve his principal foreign policy aims. First, the annexation of the four eastern oblasts of Ukraine and establishment of a puppet government in Kyiv that will do his bidding. This will, in turn, set the conditions for him to move on to other former Soviet states, such as Moldova, Georgia and even Romania. Second, the establishment of a new Yalta under which Russia dominates, once again, through the rollback of Nato from Eastern Europe and the abandonment of our allies to Putin’s new empire. Third, the neutralisation, and potentially the destruction of Nato, an alliance Putin sees as a direct threat to Russia. Fourth, the decoupling of America from European security and defence. We should not be surprised. Trump has, after all, already stuck a dagger into the heart of allied cohesion with his threats to two loyal Nato allies, the takeover of Greenland and the incorporation of Canada as the 51st State. Not only must Europe and Canada recognise the long-term threat to transatlantic security posed by Russia, but under no circumstances should they accept America’s appeasement of Putin and abandonment of Ukraine. Thus far, European leaders – from Kaja Kallas, the redoubtable former prime minister of Estonia, now the European Union’s foreign policy chief, to Nato secretary general Mark Rutte and the UK’s defence secretary John Healey, have been unequivocal: no appeasement of Putin, no deal without Ukrainian acceptance and continued support for Ukraine. To his credit, Keir Starmer has also stated unequivocally his support for Ukraine’s membership of Nato. But more is needed. Words must be translated into “action this day” as Churchill would have directed. Nato and the EU, without America but in conjunction with Ukraine and other partners like Australia and South Korea, must design a strategy to support Ukraine and impose such unacceptable pain on Russia that Putin understands he can’t get his way. This means European members of Nato coordinating efforts to give Ukraine the military means needed. The reality is that every time Ukraine’s partners have escalated support, Putin has rattled the nuclear sabre and every time he has backed down. Add to this the ammunition, tanks, artillery, mine warfare and other capabilities needed for Ukraine to defend itself. Concurrently, we must work with Ukraine to support the reforms needed to build a new model Ukrainian army, which has the manpower, command and control, training and logistics to achieve this. It also requires Europe to harness its technological genius in every way possible to deliver new and battle-winning capabilities to Ukraine, as well as reflect on the way that Ukraine has harnessed its own technological ingenuity such as autonomous vehicles, state-of-the-art drones, AI-enabled kill chain from intelligence and surveillance to strike. In the short term, if a ceasefire is brokered, an implementation force will likely be required to enforce peace along 1,000km of Ukrainian/Russian front line. This is not a task for a traditional blue beret, flag-waving UN force cobbled together from South America, Asia or Africa. Implementing a ceasefire will need mass, precision and scale unseen in Europe since the days of the Cold War, together with state-of-the-art fighting capabilities and the leadership, training and determination to fight boots on the ground if necessary. Of course, the brutal truth is that this will come at a cost; treasury resources will be stretched to the limit and hard political decisions and sacrifice will be needed. However, this is no more than the sacrifices our fellow Nato members like Poland, Finland, Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania have already made. The bottom line is that these decisions have to be faced now if we are to be safe. As an immediate action, the UK should take the lead in encouraging all Nato European nations to adopt Estonia’s proposal and set aside 0.25 per cent of GDP for a Ukrainian defence fund for the next four years. This would generate around €150bn. Appeasers in Europe may scoff and say this is a chimera, it’s not possible without the US. I disagree. Of course, it would be better to have the US on board, but those days have gone, the world has changed utterly, and we can no longer rely on the Americans. We have to help ourselves. Europe is rich: the combined GDP of Nato’s European members is 15 times that of Russia, and together it has the resources to develop the military capability needed to meet its needs without American support. But it will need courage, bold leadership and iron determination to make it happen. It will also need time. There can be no delay. Munich 1938 fired the starting gun for Britain’s preparation for the Second World War. Let Munich 2025 do the same to avoid a third world war. Only when a long-term deterrence of Russia is put in place can we ensure peace for several generations to come.

It doesn’t take you long behind that multi-function wheel to realise that you can punt this incredibly capable machine as wilfully as you wish, and all it will ever do is obey your commands, all the while accompanied by a symphonic soundtrack from the three-litre twin-turbo BMW straight-six unit. It’s always communicative. It may be my imagination, or just some clever software, but it feels as if the car is actually always anticipating your next move. Sharp braking (I wanted to check how good they are – they’re flawless) provokes a most insistent growl because your M4 Competition knows that you’ll be wanting to [get a move on](/cars/electric-vehicles/porsche-macan-review-electric-car-b2600290.html) presently.

On the motorway, or even on a damp, narrow, serpentine country B-road, you are [never ever allowed to get out of your depth](/life-style/motoring/maserati-grancabrio-car-review-trofeo-b2693527.html). The compulsory four-wheel drive system helps it to make sure it goes where it thinks you want it to go, and there’s no rear-drive-only option for the hooligans/professionals. This is just as well. The personality is that of a civilised car – grown up. In its standard settings it’s quick but fairly docile, and refined, and you can pootle around town. The M1 and M2 red buttons tactically placed on the steering wheel will instantaneously add noise and performance to your adventures, when the moment is right; and both can be set to your own bespoke tastes for suspension, engine response, steering and so on. Big bonus? I could bang on about its handling at the limit, but I didn’t take it on a track, and I’m not sure, as I’ve indicated, that it would ever allow me to over-stress it. Instead I need to tell you that this car has the best heater I’ve experienced in recent memory, complemented by toasty heated seats and steering wheel. I’d fancy that it has something to do with that big engine generating so much power, but it was very noticeable how quickly things warmed up, in every sense. The huge one-piece screen for dash, satnav and controls was attractive, the Harman Kardon audio system sublime, and the display and the voice controls worked pretty well too. Less welcome? The sculptural carbon-fibre seats, trimmed in my example in a garish, tangerine soft leather, are firm, huggy and comfortable – but the car is low-slung and the big side-bolsters make getting in and out an undignified business. It entirely destroys any sense of “cool” you might possess on emerging from such a “statement” vehicle. And what statement is that? Well, it’s a coupe, which always means that you’re not so bothered about practicality and value for money – correctly so in this case, as it’s a few thousand quid more than the M3 four-door saloon it’s based on (“less car for more money” is why the manufacturers usually make coupes). That said, I have to add that the little rear seats will fold flat, which adds some versatility to its conventional boot – a hatchback would work better. It’s a BMW made in the best traditions of the company, where the quality of the engineering makes everything look and feel just right. It’s not a very beautiful car, to be honest, as most BMW coupes in recent decades have been. So again, it feels traditional – understated, and pricier than it looks. I often hop into a press car and try to guess how much power it’s packing, how fast it goes, how heavy it is and, of course, how expensive the particular package is. On checking the data this time, I found that some of my impressions were correct – it gives around 500bhp, and does zero to 60 in a few seconds; but it feels far lighter than it actually is – 1.8 tonnes. It’s also way more expensive – this latest tuned “Competition” version of the M4, albeit with “Track” and a comfort package, pushes its price way past £100,000. A lesser 4-series coupe costs less than half of that. I also didn’t expect the top speed to be 180mph. Just imagine that – and if you can, and it’s not enough, there is also an M4 CS that promises “maximum agility, precision and dynamics for both the road and the racetrack”. Love it as I did, I don’t think the M4 Competition could quite be said to be stunning value for money, but it comes pretty close, given the pleasure you’ll derive from it. It also occurs to me, though, that its very exclusivity and relative rarity, as well as its outright ability, mark it out as a future classic. In real terms, in a decade or two and looked after, it will probably be worth more than you paid for it. Question is whether you’ll be able to find somewhere that still sells petrol by then...

It remains [one of the most important and emotionally essential film genres in existence](/arts-entertainment/films/features/romantic-comedy-elizabeth-sankey-documentary-interview-a8999226.html). And that’s despite almost all of them being exactly the same. And a staggering amount of them being awful. To compile the genre’s 25 best, it was important to maintain strict criteria: a romantic comedy must build to a final rush of feeling and close on a kiss (that means no Working Girl, people!), and the central romance must be the primary hook for the entire film (that means no Clueless or Legally Blonde, nerds!). The usual rules of “good filmmaking” don’t necessarily need to apply, either. The best romcoms are an immaculate fusion of perceptive storytelling, great humour and chemistry in spades. Sometimes, though, you just want to watch pretty actors flirting in immaculate surroundings. Because, truthfully, [we’re all just a bunch of lovesick romantics](/arts-entertainment/films/features/richard-curtis-movies-criticism-b2435672.html), standing in front of a television set and/or cinema screen, asking to watch beautiful people fall in love. Did your favourite make the list? 25. Pretty Woman (1990) Let’s get the obvious out of the way first: Pretty Woman sports a sleaziness so disquieting that it’s no real surprise to learn the film was originally planned to be a gritty sex work drama that ended in tragedy. Thank Cupid for the rewrites, then. The Disney-fied Pretty Woman features Julia Roberts in pure star-is-born mode, her joyous pluck overpowering the film’s murkier elements. That the film’s ostensibly heroic leading man (Richard Gere) is an LA suit who hires an escort for the week is slightly maddening. That Pretty Woman somehow makes all of this ickiness romantic? Even more so. 24. There’s Something About Mary (1998) The gross-out comedy boom of the late 1990s and early 2000s is one of the more fascinating minor genre trends in recent decades. The Farrelly brothers launched a cottage industry of films driven by cloying sentimentality and bodily functions. Most have aged poorly, but[Cameron Diaz’s sunny dream-girl radiance in There’s Something About Mary rescues the film from comic oblivion. She gives a daffy, entirely committed performance as the object of affection for a series of men each landing somewhere along a spectrum of depravity. It’s no wonder she became one of Hollywood’s biggest names in the aftermath.](/topic/CameronDiaz) 23. Gentlemen Prefer Blondes (1953) Individual scenes from Gentlemen Prefer Blondes exist in cultural memory far more than the film does as a whole. There’s also a reason for that. Marilyn Monroe’s rendition of “Diamonds Are a Girl’s Best Friend” is frothy, classic-Hollywood gorgeousness at its most primal, while her double act with Jane Russell is almost unfairly chic. But there’s additionally lovely sparkage to the film itself, its DNA found in many of the female-led comedies of the later 20th century. Monroe and Russell are scrappy, ambitious women desperate to marry rich, and the film has a surprisingly sex-positive and self-aware quality to it that feels quietly radical for 1953. Casting dullards as the pair’s respective love interests makes total sense – these are women who could eat stupid men for breakfast, and the film knows it. 22. Get Over It (2001) The most under-the-radar masterpiece of the US teen-movie boom that kicked off in the late Nineties – and drew to a close shortly around Get Over It’s release – this is essentially a “greatest hits” movie pulling from all that was popular back then. You’ve got a Shakespeare parody (the plot here is inspired by A Midsummer Night’s Dream), a sexually excitable animal (it’s very Farrelly brothers), and a host of cameos from celebs of the moment (Sisqó! Carmen Electra! Short-lived pop queen Vitamin C!). Ben Foster is the recently dumped high-school basketball player who signs up for the school play to woo back his ex, only to fall for the adorable younger sister (Kirsten Dunst) of his best friend. Stealing the show is Martin Short as a flamboyant drama teacher. More people should know this film! 21. Boomerang (1992) The first Black, mainstream romantic comedy to possess the same aspirational sheen as its white counterparts, Boomerang is a lively battle-of-the-sexes comedy with Eddie Murphy as a womanising advertising executive spurned by his female doppelganger (Robin Givens). Grace Jones, Eartha Kitt and a young Halle Berry make for wonderful supporting players, but Boomerang’s secret weapon is Givens, who gives a performance with so much spark that it’s enraging her volatile marriage to Mike Tyson overshadowed much of her acting career. 20. Love Actually (2003) Most great romcoms are lucky enough to have one standout set piece that becomes embedded in the cultural landscape. Love Actually, the annually inescapable Christmas romcom behemoth from Richard Curtis, has about six or seven. Because it’s as famous as it is, Love Actually oddly has a tendency to be underrated, dismissed as too cutesy or misogynist, too awkwardly Blairite in its politics. And all of that, in fairness, is true. But it’s also a real classic of the form – masterfully structured, endlessly watchable, and filled with familiar faces, sweet romances and heartache. It’s love in all its colours, often cringeworthy, sometimes monstrous, but always compelling to watch unfold. 19. But I’m a Cheerleader (1999) This satirical comedy set at a gay conversion camp has, quite clearly, a lot more than romance on its mind. But Jamie Babbit’s pink satin-coloured debut is most memorable for the brewing relationship between Clea DuVall’s Graham and Natasha Lyonne’s Megan. One is more in denial about their sexuality than the other, but they discover a mutual attraction while being held under the thumb of Cathy Moriarty’s conversion camp den mother – who, it should be said, is somehow more of a drag queen than her colleague (played by a de-glammed RuPaul). 18. Groundhog Day (1993) It’s easy to forget that Groundhog Day is unashamedly romantic. At its heart is that incredible concept: Bill Murray’s obnoxious weatherman is stuck in a time loop, so takes the time to better himself. Surrounding said concept is a love story between Murray’s character and the TV producer who initially can’t stand him (Andie MacDowell), and how personal betterment makes every trial and tribulation somehow worthwhile. 17. Bull Durham (1988) Romcoms don’t typically depict sex – preferring either morning-after giggles or absolutely nothing carnal whatsoever. Then there’s Bull Durham, starring Susan Sarandon as a ludicrously sexy and free-spirited baseball groupie who picks one player to sleep with every game season. Kevin Costner and Tim Robbins are the two men Sarandon gets involved with, sparking a shaggy yet erotically charged tete-a-tete. 16. Say Anything… (1989) Sometimes all it takes to forgive a romcom of its creepy undercurrent is a pair of beautiful movie stars with impeccable chemistry. In fairness, that occurs throughout the romantic comedy genre, but it’s especially noticeable in Cameron Crowe’s Say Anything... This is a story about fixation and co-dependency and poor Ione Skye stuck in the middle of two incredibly needy men, but Crowe somehow makes Say Anything... strikingly romantic anyway. Skye and John Cusack are wonderful together; the film takes its time allowing us to fall in love with them just as they’re falling in love with each other. And that boombox scene is iconic for a reason. 15. Modern Romance (1981) Sick of beautiful people falling in love in movies? Why not watch two beautiful people fall in love and then endlessly dissect their relationship to death? Modern Romance is practically an anti-romcom, writer, director and star Albert Brooks swimming in such narcissistic neurosis as a Los Angeles film editor that he makes Woody Allen look comparatively content. His film recognises love as completely toxic and unbearable when cast in a particular light, and few dark comedies have come close to matching its gnarly wit ever since. 14. The Wedding Singer (1998) On paper, Adam Sandler and Drew Barrymore shouldn’t work so well together. They’re not quite opposites, with their comic zing not sourced from anything combative – as in most romcoms. Oddly, it’s their shared sensibilities that make them so transfixing on screen. Both are unabashedly sweet-natured, earnest and goofy movie stars who radiate heart. More than their middling reunion movie 50 First Dates or their woeful third go-around Blended, The Wedding Singer best captures their mutual affability. Soundtracked by an A to Z of 1980s pop classics, this is nostalgic, adorable and endlessly rewatchable. 13. Bridget Jones’s Diary (2001) It is funny in hindsight that there was such a stink over the casting of the Texan Renée Zellweger as the very English Bridget Jones. Because could you now imagine anyone else playing her? Her accent flawless (in that very prim, written-by-Richard-Curtis way), Zellweger similarly nails the spirited, neurotic melancholy that makes Bridget such a likeable character, despite all the reasons we probably wouldn’t be able to stand her in reality. Like most of Curtis’s work, there is a lovely comfort to Bridget Jones, full as it is of slapstick, silly jumpers and new-millennium London, featuring Colin Firth and Hugh Grant (as “adorable dork” and “magnificent bastard”, respectively), and a perfect Christmas finale. 12. Moonstruck (1987) Cher won a surprising yet entirely deserved Oscar for her work here, playing a dowdy Brooklyn widow engaged to an incredibly boring man, who decides to transform herself after falling for her soon-to-be brother-in-law (Nicolas Cage). Moonstruck is a love story and a traditional romcom, but it’s also the story of a woman throwing herself into the unknown and abandoning the kind of life she once felt resigned to. It is big, broad and richly romantic, with a touch of magical whimsy thrown in too. 11. Four Weddings and a Funeral (1994) An underwritten female lead in the form of Andie MacDowell’s Carrie is the only fly in the ointment here. Revolving around a group of friends as they attend – you guessed it – four weddings and a funeral, this 1994 sleeper hit marked the first of many collaborations between Hugh Grant and screenwriter Richard Curtis. We can probably all agree that the hopeless, stuttering Charlie should have ended up with his best friend Fiona (Kristin Scott Thomas), but without his devastating indifference towards her, we would never have been blessed with one of the most magnanimous displays of unrequited love ever committed to film. The film’s worth your time, too, for its quietly progressive, heart-wrenching gay subplot. 10. Roman Holiday (1953) A perfect encapsulation of the Fifties, specifically the allure of the European jet set, the idealised rat-a-tat-tat magic of big-city journalists, and the otherworldly regality of Audrey Hepburn, Roman Holiday is more of a time machine than most of the films here. But it’s also a true-blue classic, its “famous woman paired with ordinary man” plot inspiring everything from Notting Hill to The Lizzie McGuire Movie, and appropriately beloved as a result. There’s no Hilary Duff, obviously, but we won’t hold that against it. 9. My Best Friend’s Wedding (1997) Considering how many people adore My Best Friend’s Wedding, it’s always surprising to rediscover how monstrous its apparent heroine is. Julia Roberts has had better-received roles before and since, but there’s something fascinatingly daring about her work here, playing a single woman in love with her best friend and determined to destroy his wedding to a lovely if naive rich girl she has decided is evil. Cameron Diaz, as the bride-to-be, is an adorable revelation, Rupert Everett a hoot as Roberts’s then-radical “gay best friend”. And the sheer darkness on display here, mixed with that funny and expensive Nineties sheen, makes it one of the most intriguing romcoms in history, and secretly one of its very best. 8. 10 Things I Hate About You (1999) Gut-wrenching to watch in the wake of Heath Ledger’s death, but still one of the smartest, most heartwarming comedies of the last 30 years. Ledger and Julia Stiles are a pair of “unappealing” high schoolers whose romance is engineered by Stiles’s younger sister, who can only date once she does. There is much to love here, from the film’s feminist politics (10 Things remains the holy grail of its era, in that regard) to its delightful supporting cast. But it’s Ledger and Stiles that burn the screen. Their chemistry is so authentic, charming and sexy that it’s almost uncomfortable to watch, with only the fact that they’re both ridiculously beautiful encouraging you to not once look away. 7. Annie Hall (1977) We know. Where you stand on[Woody Allen’s work, particularly the stuff not revolving around the apparent inability of young women to resist the allure of a scrawny, bespectacled middle-aged neurotic, is one of those endless pop culture conundrums we’ve attempted to decipher in recent years. If anything, though, watch Annie Hall for Diane Keaton at her most Diane Keatonish – daffy, stylish and impossibly cool, she becomes so much more than an idealised fantasy figure through sheer force of will.](/topic/WoodyAllen) 6. The Apartment (1960) Christmas has never been better presented in all its melancholy splendour than in Billy Wilder’s The Apartment, in which two lonely souls left dispirited by the holiday season find one another. Jack Lemmon is unsurprisingly wonderful as one half of the film’s central twosome, who loans out his apartment to his lecherous bosses so they can conduct their affairs, but it is Shirley MacLaine who provides the film with its heart – she is bruised and brittle but eager for connection, and perfectly embodies the dizzying emotions of the winter season. 5. The Philadelphia Story (1940) A fizzy treasure of a comedy that set the tone for much of what came after it, The Philadelphia Story casts a never-more-haughty Katharine Hepburn as an heiress stuck between three men: her dull fiance (John Howard), a prickly journalist (James Stewart) and the ex (Cary Grant) still hopelessly in love with her. Everyone speaks incredibly fast, romantic tribulations occur in elegant mansion estates, and the film’s central trio embody a vintage movie-star glamour you can’t help but begin to long for as soon as they appear on screen. 4. Notting Hill (1999) Oh, isn’t this just perfect? The on-location filming. Rhys Ifans in his pants. Emma Chambers as a sweet-natured flibbertigibbet. That immaculate swoosh of Hugh Grant’s hair. Julia Roberts being so Julia Roberts that I feel as if I ought to write her name in capital letters here just to accurately capture the scale and power of her presence. Notting Hill, about a bookseller who falls in love with an A-list movie star who might as well be called Schmoolia Schmoberts, is the real apex of British romantic comedy, isn’t it? Incredibly funny, irresistibly gentle, and just burning with confidence, expense and Nineties, produced-by-Working-Title charm. You’d live in it if you could. Damn you, gentrification! 3. You’ve Got Mail (1998) While Tom Hanks and Meg Ryan’s most famous prior romcom collaboration, 1993’s Sleepless in Seattle, has a dark melancholy that makes it less immediately pleasurable to watch, their 1998 reunion in You’ve Got Mail is the kind of movie built for comforting rewatches beneath a blanket. Or at least once every year at Christmas. The pair play sworn enemies waged in a war over the future of Ryan’s ludicrously serene independent bookshop, who simultaneously fall in love with one another when interacting anonymously online. Despite the dial-up modems and archaic dialogue (“What’s email?” everyone seems on the verge of asking), You’ve Got Mail hasn’t aged poorly, proving how timeless chemistry-driven love stories between beautiful movie stars can be. And considering how brilliant Ryan is here, oscillating between tough strength and soft vulnerability, it is no surprise that she is still regarded as the star most associated with the genre. 2. What’s Up, Doc? (1972) This Peter Bogdanovich blockbuster is a full-speed collision of slapstick, romance and shocking sex appeal – has any couple been more attractive on screen than Barbra Streisand and Ryan O’Neal, before or since? The pair play unlikely allies who smash into one another at a San Francisco hotel – he’s an uptight businessman with a steady girlfriend, she’s a manic pixie dream woman who upends his life professionally, personally and psychologically. But, like, in a romantic way. Much like number one on this list, What’s Up, Doc? is more or less the blueprint for every madcap action-romance that came after it. 1. When Harry Met Sally… (1989) Truthfully, it couldn’t be anything else. Not only did When Harry Met Sally… kickstart the romcom boom that dominated the Nineties, it also invented much of what we recognise today as cliches: from the sardonic best friend (played to perfection by Carrie Fisher), to the late-night phone calls while watching old movies, the Christmas/New Year’s climax, the “neurotic Jew”/“Shiksa goddess” pairing at its centre, and the hilarious honesty when it comes to sex – never bettered than in the film’s standout diner-orgasm scene. Romantic comedies are only cliched because When Harry Met Sally… set such a glorious benchmark for why these films work in the modern era, assisted by Billy Crystal and Meg Ryan at their most golden, and a gorgeously structured script that leaps through time, written by the queen of the genre herself, Nora Ephron. Nothing will ever better this.

79593660,Can Kim Leadbeater justify her assisted dying bill?,The MP behind this ethically transformative piece of legislation answers her critics.,"I almost didn’t get to speak to Kim Leadbeater. The 48-year-old Labour MP for Spen Valley is in such high demand that she rescheduled our interview – twice. In fact, in the lift on the way up to her parliamentary office on an inconspicuous wood-panelled corridor of Portcullis House, I was told by a member of her team that she had nearly cancelled. It was a bracing day in January, and she fitted me in after another commitment, racing back from the Ministry of Justice, bristling with energy. Her animated air is easy to understand. Leadbeater has risen to national attention in recent weeks as a result of her ongoing sponsorship of a private members’ bill to legalise assisted dying, currently making its way through the Commons. This back-bench form of legislation doesn’t usually demand quite so much of its sponsor’s time, nor does it typically make the MP in question headline news: other ongoing, and more anonymous, examples currently include a bill to outlaw deepfake porn while another aims to relax alcohol licensing hours. But Leadbeater’s proposed law is different. Tabled towards the end of last year, the Terminally Ill Adults (End of Life) Bill has triggered something quite rare in politics: a national debate about our collective ethics. If it passes into legislation later this year, terminally ill patients with six months or less to live will be legally permitted to end their own lives. It could fundamentally change our attitude towards medicine and concepts of care in our society – and our relationship with death itself. The use of a private members’ bill – rather than a standard, government-led submission – for this kind of thorny, emotional and contentious issue is routine. The 1967 Abortion Act which legalised the termination of unwanted pregnancies (under certain conditions) was a private members’ bill tabled by the Liberal MP David Steel. Leadbeater’s was first brought before Parliament in November last year and passed through its second reading in the Commons by 330 votes to 275. It proposes giving terminally ill people the right to choose to end their own life, a change to current law which, if broken, risks imprisonment or criminal charges for those involved. When we met, Leadbeater described the UK’s existing laws as an “injustice” – something which, she said she has “always had a very strong sense of dealing with”. To qualify for assisted dying – as the bill currently stands – patients must be over 18, live in England or Wales and have been registered with a GP for 18 months. It stipulates that they must have the mental capacity to make the choice and be deemed to have expressed a clear, settled and informed wish, free from coercion or pressure. They must be expected to die within six months and must make two separate declarations (both of which must be witnessed and signed) about their wish to die. Their decision must also receive sign-off from two doctors and – when I spoke to Leadbeater – a High Court judge. A week prior to our interview, [the Times reported](https://www.thetimes.com/uk/politics/article/assisted-dying-bill-drop-requirement-high-court-judge-2gkm5kc6b) that the required judicial sign-off was on the verge of being dropped in favour of a vaguely described “panel of experts”. From the moment Leadbeater’s bill was selected in the Speaker’s ballot, concerns around whether it would include appropriate safeguards to protect vulnerable people from being coerced into this process were rife – with many MPs only voting in favour on the condition of the High Court’s inclusion. Somewhat surprisingly, Leadbeater told me some voices have accused her bill of being too cautious compared to assisted dying laws in countries like Canada, where judicial approval is not a requirement. Twice during our interview, Leadbeater mentioned evidence given during the bill’s committee stage by England’s chief medical officer, Chris Whitty, who warned of creating a “bureaucratic thicket” if safeguards were made too complicated. (It should be noted that in the same session Whitty also said it is “extremely difficult” for a doctor to assess when a terminally ill patient might die.) “Some countries would say to me, ‘Actually, Kim, you’re making this too difficult for people who are dying by adding all of these different layers.’ I disagree. I think we need another layer of safeguarding and scrutiny [above medical approval]. A High Court judge, I think, is a very effective way of doing that.” But when I asked Leadbeater directly, she confirmed that removing the High Court judge requirement was her intention: “What I have found from many meetings that I’ve had with different organisations and professionals is that perhaps a multidisciplinary approach would be better.” Leadbeater explained that this so-called panel of experts could include social workers, psychiatrists and others involved “in that patient’s health and care journey”. [Writing in the Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/feb/10/right-to-die-dignified-death-assisted-dying-bill-safeguarding), Leadbeater has explained that the panel would have a “legal chair”, describing the change as “judge plus”. Since the amendment was tabled, several previously supportive MPs have begun to waver. One Labour MP who voted for the bill at its second reading but plans to vote against when it returns to the Commons told me she is in favour of assisted dying in principle but cannot back the bill in its current form – a decision she described as “distressing”. The multidisciplinary nature of this “panel of experts” would mirror the multidisciplinary way in which terminally ill patients are treated, Leadbeater explained. “This isn’t something which I think should sit outside of the NHS, or healthcare more broadly,” she told me, “because this is our opportunity to take a really holistic approach to end-of-life care, conversations and choice. If you remove it from everything else, that just doesn’t feel right to me.” This holistic, parallel approach makes sense in an ideal world, but it is a high bar for an NHS which is on its knees. Figures from NHS England for the week ending 4 February revealed that [96 per cent of adult hospital beds were occupied](https://www.england.nhs.uk/statistics/statistical-work-areas/uec-sitrep/urgent-and-emergency-care-daily-situation-reports-2024-25/) and waiting lists remain high. Is the health service ready for an undertaking as complex as this – materially and morally? Leadbeater thinks so. “The thing to remember is these are not new patients. We’re not going to suddenly have an influx of new patients in the NHS; these patients are terminally ill. They will already be under the treatment of a doctor.” Though that may be true, the delivery of assisted dying will depend on having adequate resources to do so safely. Yet the NHS is chronically understaffed and underresourced – so too is the UK’s ailing social care system. Last year the Health Secretary, Wes Streeting, expressed his concern that the introduction of assisted dying in England and Wales would divert resources from other operations or services. But Leadbeater has a resolute conviction that the crisis in the NHS is a surmountable problem, and her outlook is a clarion call to the government. “It’s absolutely right to acknowledge we have an NHS facing serious problems,” she said, “but the start of government is the right time to deal with those problems.” Though the government has remained neutral on this bill and allowed MPs a free vote on the issue, some cabinet members have expressed their opinions publicly. Streeting and the Justice Secretary, Shabana Mahmood – within whose briefs assisted dying would fall – have both come out against the bill. In October, Mahmood told the Times she would vote against the legislation due to her belief in the “sanctity” of human life. Streeting’s opposition stems from a concern that end-of-life care in the UK is not good enough. Is the opposition of two essential, high-profile cabinet members a concern for Leadbeater? “I fully respect that within parliament there are a range of views,” she said, “but ultimately, the Leader of the House [Lucy Powell] has said, on multiple occasions, that if this is passed, the government will step in to make sure it is workable and operable.” Though she added, smiling nervously: “I’m friends with these people, so it really matters to me that all those different views are respected.” On 16 June 2016, Leadbeater’s sister Jo Cox was murdered. The 41-year-old MP for Batley and Spen in Yorkshire was shot and killed by Thomas Mair, a far-right activist, while on the way to a constituency surgery to meet local residents. Cox was born in Batley and her family still lived in the area. Her murder, which took place just days before the Brexit referendum, brought British politics to a standstill. Five years later, Leadbeater was selected as the Labour candidate in a by-election to replace Tracy Brabin as the MP for Batley and Spen. Before becoming an MP, Leadbeater was a lecturer in physical health at the University of Bradford and a personal trainer. This craving for activity has stuck with her; as we said goodbye after the interview, Leadbeater bounced around on the balls of her feet as if warming up for an afternoon of jogging. By entering parliament, Leadbeater is continuing her sister’s legacy, but the terrible shock of her death has had a deep and lasting impact. In some ways, it has influenced her position on assisted dying. “I think, if I’m honest, my own experience of death, particularly following the murder of my sister – you have a situation there where you literally have no control, in the worst way possible,” Leadbeater told me. “What assisted dying does, in very different circumstances, is it gives people an opportunity to take control in their most difficult times and when they’re at their most vulnerable.” It’s obvious why Leadbeater feels so strongly about this issue: it’s personal. Throughout our interview she fizzes with determination, clearly galvanised by the opportunity to make a difference. But a bill such as this is a major undertaking – and Leadbeater visibly takes criticism personally, bristling each time a critique is put to her. The bill has plenty of opponents. One prominent voice is the Conservative MP Danny Kruger, who is also a member of the bill committee. Kruger told me that he and Leadbeater do not “agree” on the “dangers of the bill” in that it could lead to vulnerable people being coerced. Since it was announced that the requirement for approval from a High Court judge would be removed, Kruger’s concerns have intensified. “I think it’s wrong on a number of levels,” he told me. “More than anything else, it was that element of the bill that secured its passage at second reading. I think to scrap it now at the committee stage is really bad.” But Leadbeater is resolute in her belief in the bill. “As someone who’s been living and breathing this, I can tell you: it hasn’t been rushed; it has been done extremely thoroughly; and there are some fantastic people working very hard on it,” she said. “Look, if we’re honest, there are some people who would never, ever vote for a piece of legislation like this for a variety of reasons,” she added. An issue raised by both sides is the risk of [coercion](https://www.newstatesman.com/politics/feminism/2025/02/how-the-assisted-dying-bill-could-unleash-male-violence) – something that is notoriously hard to detect and to prove. If assisted dying is introduced, how will the legislation protect vulnerable patients from being pressured into making such a momentous decision? Leadbeater insists she is working on measures to stop this from happening. “I’ve laid down amendments about multiple assessments for capacity and multiple opportunities to check for coercion,” Leadbeater told me, adding that its prevention “really means a lot to myself and to parliamentary colleagues”. “I think it’s an enormous bill she’s carrying,” said Kruger; “it’s an enormous burden which would usually be carried by government. This is a bill that is bigger than anything the government is doing; it’s possibly the most important piece of legislation that we’ve had in parliament for the past century.” Kruger is right. If this bill passes, terminally ill patients in England and Wales will be able to access a service that legally allows them to end their own lives. Such a colossal change in the law must be carried out safely. “People in politics and the media want to get obsessed with process,” Leadbeater said, clearly exasperated, “and I understand that’s important.” She added: “But for me, it is about the human beings at the centre of this. [We must] bring the conversation back to them.” [See also: [We need to talk about dying](https://www.newstatesman.com/comment/2024/12/we-need-to-talk-about-dying)]",newstatesman.com,https://www.newstatesman.com/politics/health/2025/02/can-kim-leadbeater-justify-her-assisted-dying-bill,[],['Tiingo Top'],2025-02-14,2025-02-14,0,1,51,85,12877
79593661,Labour’s progressive centre has collapsed,The party is appealing to a socially conservative base at the cost of its more liberal-minded voters.,"The polls are showing some strange numbers right now. Reform, according to my model Britain Elects, are tied with Labour for first place at 25 per cent each. The Conservatives are on 22 per cent. The Lib Dems on 13 per cent; the Greens are on eight. Council by-election results are giving credence to these numbers, too. These are not the product of overly logged-on, overly skewed samples. They are, it appears, a representative product of public opinion. Labour, anxious about shedding votes to Reform, are running a series of adverts aping the party’s brand and rhetoric. The adverts boast about government deportations and use that familiar Reform shade of blue. The prevailing rhetoric is that Labour feels so under attack from the right that it feels it has to out-Farage Farage. Any MP worth their constituency’s salt would readily admit that their voters are more diverse than their party activists might appreciate. Liberal-minded MPs should know a not-insubstantial proportion of their vote is more socially conservative than they are. [Because such is the case for most of the country](https://www.qmul.ac.uk/mei/news-and-opinion/archive-2020-2022/items/should-no10-prepare-for-a-war-on-woke-professor-tim-bale-.html). But these adverts are not necessarily a sound strategy. If an election were held now, as many as 1.3 million of those that backed Labour last year would switch to the Liberal Democrats or the Greens. Notwithstanding the 0.4 million who would move from the Liberal Democrats and Greens to Labour, the direction of travel is pretty clear. This YouGov data, which helps gauge how the country would split in a straight two-horse race, has some limitations. YouGov and others refrain from including the undecideds in polls like these. What proportion of Green voters in a Labour-vs-Reform fight, for instance, would sit it out? We know that of those with an opinion the split is nine-to-one in Labour’s favour. But that doesn’t tell us the whole story. If it’s nine-to-one of only 10 per cent who turn out, that’s not very helpful. Therein lies our problem: we know active progressive voters will rank Labour before the Tories, and the same goes for Reform, but what proportion of those progressives would be unbothered in fights like these? What proportion have reached the stage where a Labour government to them is no better than a Conservative one? We don’t know yet. All we can say is this: Labour needs to remain a world away from the Conservatives and Reform in perception, lest these progressives look upon both and say, “What’s the difference? Why should I bother?” What triggered this piece? Labour is tacking right on boats and borders both in policy and rhetoric to stymie Reform. It’s an appreciable reaction. But will it turn off the socially liberal? Something to consider in closing is that those who support parties of the left are not roundly advocates for open borders. Some activists might be. But the voters, generally, across every strata, agree with the sentiment that net migration numbers need to be cut. The debate now is not whether immigration numbers should be cut. That discussion’s been had. The debate now is about how. And all the parties need to come to terms with that.

79593665,"Theodore Roosevelt, the Tories’ new philosopher-king","As Kemi Badenoch’s authority crumbles, British conservatism is searching for a new figurehead.","Crisis sends people scouring the past, in search of a way forward. Talking to Conservatives in the months since their catastrophic loss last July, even before [Kemi Badenoch](https://www.newstatesman.com/tag/kemi-badenoch) flopped, I kept finding the conversation turning to a time and place that seems a world away from our stagnating land: the booming, bullish America of the early 20th century. And in particular to the US president Theodore Roosevelt, the great “progressive Republican”. It’s a label that resembles more recent attempts to escape outdated orthodoxies, such as “Red Tory” and its newly resurgent twin, “[Blue Labour](https://www.newstatesman.com/politics/uk-politics/2025/02/where-next-for-blue-labour)”. So can Roosevelt offer the Conservatives what those movements never achieved: a political programme that is not just popular, but transformative? As an antidote to our timid, worn-out, pissed-off politics, Roosevelt is hard to beat. Here was a high-born New York weakling who built himself up by force of will into a real-life tough guy. When his wife and his mother died on the same day, he grieved by decamping to the Dakotas and turning himself into a rancher. (Admittedly, he left his child behind with his family.) As police commissioner in New York, he fought corruption; when America went to war with Spain over Cuba, he resigned from government and leaped into the fray. By the time he was 42, he’d hammered out a barrage of books about hard-won victories, such as The Naval War of 1812 and The Winning of the West. In 1900, to contain their turbulent son, the Republican establishment shunted him into the vice-presidency under William McKinley. But months later, an anarchist shot his boss, landing Teddy in the White House. It’s hard to imagine Badenoch – or Jenrick, or Mel Stride – aping Roosevelt’s antics: jumping off a horse in Colorado, for instance, to kill a cougar with a knife. And in office, Roosevelt directed all that energy against the overweening power of corporations like Standard Oil: bringing a battery of anti-trust cases, creating a Department of Commerce and Labor, pushing for legislation against the abuse of workers. He made a point of travelling the heartland, meeting voters face to face. He would break taboos to get things done, intervening in talks between unions and bosses to resolve a miners’ strike. He appears to have been guided by a rare sense of moral mission. For some of our more thoughtful Conservatives, all this is makes Roosevelt quite a draw. In the wake of fighting the companies that wrapped Grenfell Tower in lethal cladding, Michael Gove was looking for a historical figure of the right who had championed an active state. Roosevelt, who was “undeniably conservative”, fitted the bill. “He believed in national greatness,” Gove told me. “He was in no way a squish or a milquetoast liberal, or unafraid of proclaiming the virtues of his country and its way of life.” Gove recently became the chair of the right-leaning think tank Onward’s editorial board, having worked with Nick Timothy MP and Gavin Rice on its “Future of Conservatism” project. (Timothy is not currently officially affiliated with Onward.) Rice, now the think tank’s head of political economy, similarly admires Roosevelt’s attempts to use the state for “generating economic fairness, productive markets that deliver rising prosperity for all, not just for economic elites, and prioritising the national interest”. Rice was inspired by the sociologist Robert Putnam, whose 2020 book The Upswing charts how, in the decades after Roosevelt and the progressive movement used government to tackle corporate concentrations of power, ordinary Americans flourished. Some other younger Tories think likewise. Andrew O’Brien, until recently at Demos, was once an enthusiastic Thatcherite, but when George Osborne’s shrinking of the state failed to revive growth, it forced O’Brien to reconsider. In search of centre-right models for state intervention, he looks to Harold Macmillan, but admits that for today’s Conservatives, Roosevelt is “more dynamic”. Another long-time Conservative told me campaigning for leaseholders’ rights had opened his eyes to “market abuse” everywhere – by alcohol and gambling lobbies, and the alliance between big food companies and supermarkets. He too appreciates Roosevelt’s battles against concentrations of power, suggesting that the long alliance between Tories and economic liberals is at “breaking point”. Attacks on “vested interests” often default to targeting the state, but the precedent of Roosevelt’s power struggle with corporations might help extend the attack to rent-seeking companies. Gove, who once battled the “Blob” in education, argues that the right should do the same in the private sector. In government, he denounced the big housebuilders as a “cartel”. He now singles out the tactics of private equity, and the water industry’s exploitation of weak regulation. In recent weeks, these questions have snapped into focus with the [government](https://www.newstatesman.com/tag/uk-government)’s latest dash for growth. Some of its announcements could be cast as a Rooseveltian push to overcome special interests for the nation’s benefit: overriding Nimbyism; steering surplus capital in pension funds towards investment in our infrastructure. The Water Bill, meanwhile, promises criminal sanctions against negligent company bosses; through the workers’ rights reforms, state power will restrain exploitative practices. But at the same time, the government has swung the opposite way. It has replaced the assertive chair of the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) with the ex-head of Amazon UK; a hundred CMA jobs are scheduled to be cut. Regulators must now be “pro-business”; Starmer has assured [Donald Trump](https://www.newstatesman.com/tag/donald-trump) that deregulation is a priority. Some of the Conservatives I spoke to share the criticisms of the CMA. But O’Brien points out that the UK’s mergers and acquisitions regime was already “very liberal”. Rice argues this could lead to “asset stripping”, “offshoring of production” and “profit margins for private equity”. Viewed through a Rooseveltian lens, Labour’s deregulatory turn suggests an opportunity for Conservative reinvention – offering to break from neoliberal shibboleths, reasserting the interests of ordinary Brits. Who knows, they might even strive to revive that postwar model in which government cooperated with British-owned companies in the national interest. It’s striking to hear David Davis – another Conservative admirer of Roosevelt – call for the state to curb corporate excess, by outlawing share buybacks, for example. He regrets that, in response to the politicised “de-banking” of Nigel Farage and others, Rishi Sunak’s government failed to “summon the bank chairmen” to No 10 to tell them “if you’re doing this to anybody… your bank licence is at risk”. Michael Gove worries that his party appears to serve the “already rich”, and calls for a “Rooseveltian approach, which was about making capitalism more dynamic and also addressing its abuses”. And in 2023, Paul Marshall, owner of Unherd and GB News – and now Gove’s patron as the owner of the Spectator – told the Alliance for Responsible Citizenship that we need “a new Teddy Roosevelt – someone who is prepared to take on the vested interests, to rid the business world of cronyism, regulatory capture, and false virtue”. But is there a single conservative thread that pulls all this together – sufficient to rescue the world’s oldest democratic party at its lowest ebb? On 31 August 1910, pursuing a quixotic bid to return to the White House, Teddy Roosevelt travelled to Osawatomie, Kansas. There, before a crowd of 30,000, he proclaimed “the New Nationalism”. This, he announced, “puts the national need before sectional or personal advantage”, and “regards the executive power as the steward of the public welfare”. This was the idea that underpinned his politics. Invoking the “nation” is a conservative cliché, but Roosevelt’s version was unusually focused on the people who actually lived in the country, not some fantasy to which most of them failed to match up. This makes it more detachable than many species of nationalism from poisonous ideas. Which is good, because Roosevelt’s thinking included plenty of those, from an imperial zest for conquest to a rather relaxed attitude to preserving liberty via racism and eugenics. None of these obsessions attract the Conservatives I spoke to. In the US, where there is also a revival of conservative interest in the Progressive Era, Republican attacks on corporations are often framed in anti-woke terms, such as by targeting diversity, equity and inclusion policies. Roosevelt-curious Tories here, by contrast, tend to name-check left-wing writers on political economy like Brett Christophers, David Edgerton and Joanna Blythman. But there is a distinctively conservative aspect of Roosevelt’s idea of nationhood they seem to admire: his emphasis on character. Employers should treat their staff decently, for instance, because it bolsters the virtue of the nation. Adam Hawksbee, ex-deputy director of Onward and now working in the private sector, suggested there is a lesson for Conservatives in a speech Roosevelt gave in Syracuse, New York, in 1903, which contended that the “line of cleavage between good citizenship and bad citizenship” is moral, not material – it separates “the rich man who does well from the rich man who does ill, the poor man of good conduct from the poor man of bad conduct”. Today’s Tories might also heed what Roosevelt told that Osawatomie crowd: “Ruin in its worst form is inevitable if our national life brings us nothing better than swollen fortunes for the few and the triumph in both politics and business of a sordid and selfish materialism.” In his later years, Roosevelt’s concern about the future of America extended to queasier territory: the birth rate. In a US that was absorbing waves of immigration, this was entangled with a racist agitation about having enough of the “right” sort of Americans. But what the British Conservatives I spoke to take from this is nothing like that. They argue that, while many people still want to have children, they are held back by economic obstacles like unaffordable housing. They suggest that the tax system could be more family-focused, and that working parents could do with stronger rights. They also worry that people are giving up on society. Amid signs that the young are souring on democracy, Roosevelt’s ideas seem to offer a way to revive a sense of common citizenship, so that people still want to raise kids. Since the Reagan-Thatcher rupture of the 1980s, Roosevelt’s insistence that the state must be the people’s instrument against powerful interests has been twisted out of shape. Government was recast as the people’s enemy, leaving CEOs free to squeeze pay, cut service quality, juice their share price, and trouser exorbitant bonuses. Polls suggest the British public thinks the rich have too much power. This has helped lay the ground for today’s despairing, self-defeating [populism](https://www.newstatesman.com/tag/populism). Could the recovery of a Rooseveltian active state forging a flourishing national community help to push back the tide? Michael Gove hopes so. He noted that Roosevelt was reacting both to vested interests and to those who savaged them. Gove thinks Roosevelt’s example “shows that a mainstream leader of the right can address those root causes”, such that “those populists at the moment who may not have answers, but do have the rhetoric and the emotion and the ability to connect can be – no pun intended – trumped”. But after 14 years in office, can the Conservatives credibly propose this, especially having presided over so many scandals? When they tried, with Theresa May’s “just about managing” rhetoric, or Boris Johnson’s “levelling up”, they struggled to make headway. Perhaps Reform itself will get there first: it has called for water nationalisation, and promised to scrap the two-child benefit cap. Yet a party whose membership is swollen with red-trousered Thatcherites and funded by a property investor would have to become something very different to pull this off. And Labour? It may not be ready to embrace a rumbustious left-wing populism that pushes back against corporate interests in patriotic terms. But the man who brought Teddy Roosevelt’s championship of an active state to fruition was the American president that British social democrats most revere. If they’re not keen on Teddy, Labour could do much more to channel the popular counter-populism of that other President Roosevelt: the father of the New Deal, FDR. Either way, while contemporary America is in deep political trouble, its history could yet give British politics a desperately needed injection of new energy and ideas.

79593710,Scrapping cash Isas would cost pensioners over 4k,"Abolishing the cash Isa would cost some pensioners more than £4,000 each over the next five years, analysis shows.","Abolishing the cash Isa would cost some pensioners more than £4,000 each over the next five years, analysis shows. Rachel Reeves has been urged by City firms to [cut lucrative Isa tax breaks](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/money/investing/isas/reeves-urged-kill-off-tax-free-cash-isa/) and re-allocate the funds in a bid to boost growth. The Treasury has failed to rule out the move. Wealth managers have warned that [cutting tax relief on cash Isas](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/money/investing/isas/how-rachel-reeves-raid-isas-cause-chaos/) – or scrapping the product altogether – could disproportionately penalise pensioners, who typically opt for a more cautious approach to savings. Calculations by wealth management firm, Quilter, show that if cash Isas were abolished, a basic-rate taxpayer with a cash Isa pot of £42,243 – the average for an over-65 saver – would face an additional £2,080 in income tax over the next five tax years. For a higher-rate taxpayer, this rises to £4,160 and for an additional-rate taxpayer, £4,680. [Cash Isas are considered a safe haven](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/money/investing/isas/fool-save-with-cash-isa/) and are popular among retirees who have accrued a considerable pot of money. There were 3.8 million cash Isa accounts held by savers aged 65 and over in 2021 to 2022, the latest year for which data is available. Savers can put up to £20,000 each year into cash Isas, which shield any interest earned from tax. Successive governments have already cut the potential tax relief by stealth by keeping the £20,000 allowance frozen since 2016. It will remain so until 2030. Last month, financial companies told the Chancellor that the £300bn held by savers in cash Isas could yield better returns if they opted for riskier [stocks and shares Isas,](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/money/investing/best-stocks-shares-isas/) while also boosting British businesses. Ministers have signalled that they are keen on the idea of reducing the tax relief on cash Isas. Emma Reynolds, the City minister, has questioned why there were “hundreds of billions of pounds in cash Isas”, adding that the country had failed to “drive an investment culture”. Ms Reeves previously called for a [£500,000 lifetime limit on Isas](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/money/tax/revealed-rachel-reevess-ambition-slash-isa-allowances/) in a 2016 article for The Independent. Torsten Bell, Labour’s new pensions minister, was formerly head of the Left-wing Resolution Foundation think tank, which has advocated a cap of £100,000. Quilter’s analysis uses an interest rate of 4.5pc between 2025 to 2026 and 2029 to 2030. It assumes that each pensioner has already maxed out their [personal savings allowance,](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/money/tax/how-tax-personal-savings-works/) which gives basic-rate taxpayers £1,000 of tax-free interest per year and higher-rate taxpayers £500.

79593616,"UK army 'so run down' it could not lead Ukraine peace force, says former chief","Lord Dannatt says up to 40,000 UK troops would be needed for such a mission and ""we just haven't got that number available"".","UK army too 'run down' to lead Ukraine peace mission: ex-chief - Published The UK military is ""so run down"" it could not lead a future peacekeeping mission in Ukraine, the former head of the army has said. Lord Dannatt told the BBC that up to 40,000 UK troops would be needed for such a mission and ""we just haven't got that number available"". It comes after Sir Keir Starmer said the UK would ""play its part"" in guaranteeing Ukraine's security after the prime minister was asked this week if he was open to sending British troops as peacekeepers. A former Nato chief told the BBC that Britain and France should lead a force of up to 100,000 troops as part of a long-term peacekeeping effort should Russia's war with Ukraine end. US President Donald Trump earlier this week announced he had had a lengthy conversation with his Russian counterpart, Vladimir Putin, and that negotiations to stop the ""[ridiculous war""](/news/articles/c04n622gzx7o) in Ukraine would begin ""immediately"". Trump then ""informed"" Volodymyr Zelensky, the Ukrainian president, of his plan. Lord Dannatt - who was head of the Army from 2006 to 2009 - agreed that a force to keep the peace would require about 100,000 troops. However he said the UK would have to supply ""quite a proportion of that and we really couldn't do it"". ""Our military is so run down at the present moment, numerically and as far as capability and equipment is concerned, it would potentially be quite embarrassing,"" he told BBC Radio 4's The Week in Westminster. ""I mean, if we were to deploy 10,000 troops, each rotation for six months, that would effectively tie up 30,000 or 40,000 troops and we just haven't got that number available. ""So there are some big issues here that today's politicians won't really have considered."" It comes as Britain's foreign and defence secretaries called on the UK and Europe to ""do more"" to ""share the burden"" of regional security in a joint article for the Daily Telegraph on Saturday. Anders Fogh Rasmussen, who was Nato secretary-general from 2009 to 2014, said ""a number of European countries need to step up to the plate"" for any peacekeeping mission in Ukraine, adding that the UK and France should lead that coalition by putting boots on the ground. ""I would let military experts determine [the number] but my guess would be between 50,000 and 100,000 troops,"" he told BBC Newsnight. As of October 2024, there were 74,612 members of the UK's regular Army forces (excluding Gurkhas and volunteers), according to the latest [Ministry of Defence (MoD) figures, external](https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/quarterly-service-personnel-statistics-2024/quarterly-service-personnel-statistics-1-october-2024). The Army has targets on how many new recruits below the rank of officer it should take on every year, set out by the MoD. These targets have been missed in almost every single financial year since 2010-11, according to a written answer to Parliament last January. - Published14 hours ago - Published3 June 2024 - Published1 day ago Lord Dannatt said the Labour government would need to ""look at their priorities"", adding: ""Yes, health, education, roads, infrastructure are important, but actually defence and the security of this nation are more important."" The crossbench peer said he believes the UK government needs to go further than its commitment of increasing defence spending to 2.5% of GDP - a pledge that they have yet to put a timeline on when it will be delivered. Zelensky has previously asked for the UK and other European allies including France to send troops to Ukraine for a peacekeeping operation after the war. Sir Keir last month signed a ""landmark"" 100-year pact with Ukraine, building on the £12.8bn the UK hass already sent to the country, with further commitments of £3bn every year for ""as long as it takes"". The UK will also continue to train Ukrainian troops, 50,000 of whom have been trained on British soil so far. David Lammy, the British foreign secretary, said he was [""very encouraged"" by his talks](/news/articles/clyelpzqn28o) on Ukraine with US Vice-President JD Vance on Friday, on the first day of the Munich Security Conference. ""We share the view that there has to be an enduring peace,"" Lammy told Reuters news agency following the meeting. ""There was an agreement that Zelensky and the Ukrainians have to be part of that negotiated deal."" However, Lammy and his defence colleague John Healey said that Putin had for two decades sought ""to recreate the Russian empire and suffocate the countries around its borders"". ""Too often in the past, the West has let him,"" they said in the Daily Telegraph. ""We did too little in 2008 when he invaded Georgia, and in 2014 when he first went into Ukraine."" In response to Lord Dannatt's comments, an MoD spokesperson said Britain's armed forces were ""respected worldwide for their professionalism and excellence"". ""Right now, the Ukrainians are still fighting with huge courage. Our government is stepping up support for Ukraine's war fighters to put them in the best possible position for any talks.

79593534,We need a Falklands solution to the Chagos Islands crisis (Top Stories),The will of the islanders must be respected,"Our British family of nations is not confined to simply the United Kingdom of England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. It includes the people of [Gibraltar](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/gibraltar/), the Falklands, Bermuda, Montserrat, and the other territories scattered across the globe. The UK Overseas Territories are not distant lands inhabited by strangers – they are a core part of our shared identity and country, and the people that live in them are as British as those in Belfast, Edinburgh, Cardiff and London. As the First Minister of Northern Ireland, I sought to forge friendships with leaders of the Overseas Territories, most notably with our European counterparts, Gibraltar. Next week, I have the privilege of visiting the [Falkland Islands](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/falkland-islands/) as part of a delegation organised by Friends of the British Overseas Territories. This visit is both an opportunity to learn more about the lives of those living on the islands, but also a chance to reflect on the broader principles of self-determination, sovereignty, and the rights of those who call the UK Overseas Territories their homes. Nowhere is this more evident than in the Falkland Islands, where the population has repeatedly reaffirmed its wish to remain British with the support of successive UK Governments, despite pressure from Argentina. The Falkland Islanders cherish their right to self-determination, just as the people of Northern Ireland do. It is against this background that I wish to highlight the plight of the Chagossian people. As the UK Government negotiates a deal with Mauritius over the sovereignty of the islands, they are doing so over the heads of the Chagossian people and failing to respect their right to self-determination. This is wrong. It is unjust. And it is something that those of us who care deeply about the UK Overseas Territories and their people must stand up against. Yet, whilst the UK Government rightly defends the other Overseas Territories’ right to self-determination, they fail the Chagossians by negotiating their future without their consent, citing the lack of a permanent population on the islands as an excuse (one of many excuses) – which is only the case because they were forcibly removed in the first place. The argument provided by the UK Government is that handing over sovereignty of the Chagos Islands to Mauritius is a way of righting a historic wrong. But what kind of justice ignores the very people who were forcibly removed from their homeland? True justice would mean allowing the Chagossians to return to their islands under British sovereignty and live side-by-side with the base on Diego Garcia; just like in Cyprus or Ascension Island. Instead, they are being told that their homeland will be handed to a country they do not wish to be part of, and one with no real claim over the islands, under a government that has shown little interest in their well-being. To identify yourself as Chagossian in Mauritius could land you with a 10-year jail sentence – what sort of free-speaking Commonwealth partner is this? But there is a bigger issue at stake, and one that should concern all of us who value the right to self-determination. If the UK Government is willing to negotiate away the sovereignty of one Overseas Territory without the full consideration of its people, what message does that send about their support for the right to self-determination across the other Overseas Territories? The principle of self-determination cannot be selectively applied. If we defend the right of the Falkland Islanders and Gibraltarians to decide their own future, we must do the same for [the Chagossians](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/world-news/2025/02/14/chagos-islanders-plea-for-territories-to-stay-british/). During my visit to the Falklands, I am looking forward to meeting people who understand what it means to fight for their identity and right to self-determination. The Falkland Islanders know what it is like to face a threat to their sovereignty from a nation with no legitimate claim. I have previously stood-up for Northern Ireland, putting the case forward that we are one British family - we must look after each other and put our interests first. That is why I am calling on people of the Overseas Territories, and people right across the UK, to stand in solidarity with the Chagossians.

79593531,Shane Patton was never the problem – refusal to take his advice was,"Victoria’s police chief commissioner has been arguing for tougher bail laws, but his requests have been constantly rejected by the state government.","- Analysis [National](/national)[Victoria](/national/victoria)[Naked City](/topic/naked-city-jbi) Shane Patton was never the problem – refusal to take his advice was There are two faces to police Chief Commissioner Shane Patton. The public one where he’s always optimistic and the one behind closed doors where he is in a constant arm wrestle with the government arguing for stronger and more resources. It is no secret Patton wanted a second term when his first five-year contract finishes in June. And while under the terms of his contract he should have been told in December, there was silence. Finally in January, after the deadline lapsed, he was told he would be renewed and offered a second contract. On Friday, a Police Association no-confidence motion was passed overwhelmingly against Patton and within hours, he was on borrowed time. The government had backflipped and wanted him to resign. He refused, and it was made clear to him the contract extension was off the table. (The appointment of a chief commissioner is a Governor in Council one, and we can’t rule out another somersault.) The vote of no confidence into Patton is a vote of no confidence into government policy, staff numbers and the pay offer on the table. Decades ago the police association executive passed a no confidence motion into Victoria’s best chief commissioner, Mick Miller, and he continued unhindered. The rank-and-file see Patton as compliant to the government, but those with knowledge of his work routine say he regularly fights with government ministers and has had a raft of requests for tougher laws rejected. The swings in the Werribee and Prahran elections have shocked the government into action, prompting Premier Jacinta Allan to recalibrate on law and order issues. She has announced a [review of the bail laws](/link/follow-20170101-p5l9e8) because of community concerns about home invaders being regularly bailed. Police that have an outstanding arrest rate relating to aggravated burglars and Patton long argued for tougher bail laws. His requests have been constantly rejected by the government. His arson, homicide and organised crime specialists deal with [Victoria’s tobacco wars](/link/follow-20170101-p5l62u) where shops are being torched on a weekly basis. Patton pointed out Victoria was the only state without an effective tobacco licensing system. He fought and won over the [age of criminal responsibility](/link/follow-20170101-p5k1wq) with the government wanting it raised to 14. It remains at 12. He persuaded the government to strengthen anti-criminal association laws that were so weak that for years they were never used. The government finally agreed to [ban outlaw motorcycles gangs wearing colours](/link/follow-20170101-p5egkj) in large public displays. Patton asked for money for IT, stronger laws for demonstrations and hate crimes, more trainers at the Police Academy and the removal of rules that award costs against police when an accused is found not guilty (this costs millions and Victoria is the only state with such provisions). All were rejected. The government refused requests for on the spot family violence orders to be issued by police, saving thousands of court hours, and more efficient DNA legislation in line with other states. When NSW and Queensland police were drafted in for massive Melbourne demonstrations, they had to be briefed to act within the restrictions of the local Human Rights Charter – some burst out laughing. Rather than expand the force as promised, Patton has been told to strip positions to save $2 billion over four years. The move to remove Patton smacks of panic and looking for a patsy. It also shows a government in a death spiral. The chief commissioner is regularly contacted by ministers and government advisers on micromanagement issues that show a disregard for the independence of police under the doctrine of the Office of Constable. There can be no greater example than the case of former deputy commissioner Ross Guenther. Guenther is acknowledged worldwide as an expert on counterterrorism through his connection to the Five Eyes international intelligence alliance and had the portfolios of crime and operational policing. A year ago, I wrote a story quoting [Guenther’s views](/link/follow-20170101-p5f6p3) on the criminal justice system. “Why do self-interest groups and self-described experts have so much sway over issues that impact the whole community? Do we adequately respond to the needs of victims?” He said all the elements “are committed to doing good, but the system is not co-ordinated, and the elements are not working together”. His ideas made sense, including suggesting a criminal justice system summit. The government went into meltdown, gagged Guenther and blocked his career path. He has since left the force. Patton came to the job with a raft of reforms. He had a back to basics philosophy, more visible police, better connection with the local community and a more practical discipline system and a greater concentration on general duties operations. But his initial period in charge was blighted by COVID lockdowns. “COVID hurt us, there is no doubt. We had no playbook for something like that. We could have done better and it took some chips off us,” he told me. For various reasons, Victoria Police (along with every other force in Australia) has been unable to reach recruiting and retention targets, leaving it 1100 short with another 700 on long-term sick leave. He asked the government for a recruit advertising budget. It was rejected. This means Patton has been unable to reach his aim of greater street policing numbers as stations battle every night to find enough staff to fill divisional van shifts, and 43 stations meant to operate 24 hours a day now close at night. He has also been given the job of stripping back police positions to meet government expectations due to new budget restrictions. The government knows that when the then premier Jeff Kennett lost the police rank-and-file vote, he lost the election. Shane Patton was never the problem. Refusal to take his advice was. The new pay deal, signed off by Patton and the Police Association is now under threat. We are likely to have a four-month period with a caretaker chief commissioner and the position, once considered the nation’s premier police position, is now tarnished. New applicants, knowing they have to strip $2 billion off the budget, deal with a large number of resignations and retirements, a sick-leave epidemic and a chronic morale problem, may demand the very legislative changes denied to Patton in the first place. The Victorian government was contacted for comment but did not respond before deadline. John Silvester lifts the lid on Australia’s criminal underworld.

The te","The Westlake Thunder have cut into the Lone Peak Knights’ dominance. On Friday night, the Thunder secured a thrilling come from behind 45-39 victory against five-time defending region champion Lone Peak to clinch a share of the Region 3 crown. The teams both finished the regular season with an 8-2 record in region. “Well, it’s never happened at Westlake before on the girls side,” Thunder head coach Charlotte McFarlane said of winning region. “This is a huge accomplishment for our kids… Our kids have obviously shown that they can come out and compete with the best of any team.” On Friday the Thunder took an early lead but then trailed for the majority of the game. They trailed by three entering the fourth quarter before taking back the lead thanks to some tough defense and some big free throws by junior Ella Seymore. Sophomore Janiece Sikander hit a dagger 3-pointer to seal the deal for Westlake. “Janiece is a sophomore, but she’s one of the smartest basketball players I’ve ever coached,” McFarlane said. “I trust

fall league game that had almost no impact on the outcome of their season. In that game, she recalled Friday, her team joined together after an opposing player insulted a Thunder player. “The moment I could tell we were special was the amount of togetherness we had at that game,” she said. Westlake now looks ahead to the first game of the 6A playoffs next Thursday. Following the Westlake girls win, the Thunder boys followed suit, beating Lone Peak 53-46. The Thunder took revenge after a 15-point loss to the Knights earlier this season. Westlake started out hot, as it scored eight points before Lone Peak was able to find the bottom of the net. The Thunder wound up holding the Knights to well below their season average of 64.3 points per game. It was a meaningful victory for the Thunder, as they now also share the 2025 Region 3 title with Lone Peak, their first since 2021.
