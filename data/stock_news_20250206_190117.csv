Sources indicate that the release may occur soon, with sales beginning later in the month. Unlike previous launches, Apple will reportedly unveil the new device on its website without a major event. The new iPhone SE, resembling the iPhone 14, will integrate Apple's AI software, Apple Intelligence. Inventory shortages in U.S. Apple stores suggest the imminent arrival of this updated model. Current iPhone SE models, along with iPhone 14, have been discontinued in the EU due to non-compliance with USB-C standards, which the new SE will adopt. Priced at $429 currently, the new iPhone SE might see a price increase. However, it aims to remain competitive with entry-level smartphones from Samsung and Google's Alphabet. Apple hopes to revitalize its iPhone sales, following a 1% decline during the holiday season. The new SE is expected to appeal strongly to overseas markets like China and India. The upcoming model will feature Apple's first in-house cellular modem, a larger screen, Face ID, and a faster A18 chip. This release marks the removal of the Home button, first introduced in 2007, aligning with broader updates across Apple's product line, including the iPhone 17 series and other non-iPhone products.",gurufocus.com,https://www.gurufocus.com/news/2686239/apples-aapl-upcoming-iphone-se-to-boost-market-growth,"['aapl', 'ne-ws']","['Aapl', 'Article', 'Gurufocus', 'Gurufocus News', 'News', 'Stock', 'Technology', 'Unknown Sector']",2025-02-06,2025-02-06,2,8,56,160,1398
79217283,Netflix’s newest mini-series has me hooked — and it's based on a real Aussie Instagram scam,Watch the fall of Belle Gibson's empire on Netflix now,"Netflix’s newest mini-series has me hooked — and it's based on a real Aussie Instagram scam [Opinion](https://www.tomsguide.com/opinion) Watch the fall of Belle Gibson's empire on Netflix now Just when I thought [Netflix's Next On lineup](https://www.tomsguide.com/entertainment/netflix/netflix-is-back-with-a-vengeance-in-2025-these-are-the-movies-im-most-excited-about) couldn't get any better with some great content heading to the platform, I was beyond pleasantly surprised when the big red streamer's latest show, Apple Cider Vinegar, graced my screen yesterday evening (February 6). The trailer for the highly anticipated drama dropped a few weeks ago, piquing the interest of true crime fans — myself included. As someone who prefers to indulge in the lighthearted nature of sitcoms and the occasional reality show, I do find myself reaching for harder-hitting narratives and intertwinings of complex crime stories every now and again. After watching the trailer, you catch a glimpse of the glitzy, glamorous and long-gone era of the dawn of social media influencers circa 2012-2015. Nowadays, everyone's got a tripod, a vlog camera and ridiculous lighting setups, but Apple Cider Vinegar oh so carefully sends viewers back in time to the simpler days of duck lip selfies, OOTDs and the humble #Foodstagram. Apple Cider Vinegar follows the real-events-turned-wrong of the homegrown Aussie Instagrammer, Belle Gibson, and the utter undoing of her health and wellness empire after it is revealed that Gibson's main motivation — her terminal brain cancer — was a well-calculated and fabricated rouse. Now, it is important to note here that Gibson was not at all involved in the project and this is repeatedly brought up in fourth-wall disclaimers throughout the show. There are also elements of the story that are entirely fictionalized, so while a lot of the story's substance can point back to Gibson's real-life deceit, there are some plot points added for dramatic effect — but it pays off. And it's safe to say now, after watching the first half of the series, that Apple Cider Vinegar hit my pre-conceived expectations out of the park. Warning: spoilers ahead Much like what was seen in Netflix's Inventing Anna, a similar tale of socialite deception, the webs of Gibson's lies (played by Kaitlyn Dever) are much more tangled than they seem. This entanglement is portrayed so perfectly by the montage sequence in the first few minutes of the show — and is even more perfectly accompanied by the backing track of Britney Spears' ""Toxic"". From the jump, you know exactly what you're getting into. You see the rise of Belle's empire, akin to a catchy song and dance, all while being flashed aspects of her ultimate demise. It leads so well into the opening scene, in which Belle is meeting with PR agency representative and crisis manager, Hek, played by the charming Phoenix Raei. You'll need to get a better read of Belle, though, to truly understand how deluded the character is. However, Kaitlyn Dever is impeccable at stringing everyone along for the ride, including the viewer. There are moments in which you root for Dever's character, but those moments are stolen away even quicker by Gibson's actions or response. Dever's performance is utterly convincing as she lies through her teeth to her coworkers, swindles a store clerk and does the most at her baby shower to convince others (who don't end up attending) that she's got a community around her, all in episode one. (It's also worth mentioning that Dever's accent work is so true blue (damn good for non-Aussies), that I was second-guessing my own accent.) Gibson's character is encapsulated in several golden lines throughout the first few episodes, but by far, one of my favorites is said by Belle herself in episode one. When talking to breast cancer patient Lucy (Tilda Cobham-Hervey) about doctors lacking nutrition advice for chemo treatment, Belle drops the perfect pre-emptive line of ""the arrogance is criminal when you think about it""... and for me, that rings true for the entire show. Secondary to this killer line is Chanelle's (Aisha Dee) description of Belle as a ""host"", where she ""finds someone and attaches herself"". This is, again, accompanied by a perfect shot-for-shot capture of a moment where Hek almost sees through Belle's BS but then is instantly swept up into her whole worldview. Some honorable character mentions here will go to Milla, played by Alycia Debnam-Carey, who is spiteful at first introduction but is considerably unwrapped as a caring and considerate health advocate for cancer survivors after pushing back on her own treatment plans for alternative therapy. Milla's plot occurs in parallel to Belle's in the first two episodes before their worlds collide in the third. Milla's family subplot is wholesome, but at times, I wasn't as invested in it as I was in discovering Belle's true nature. Another great character here is Clive (Ashley Zukerman), Belle's partner who I won't say too much about, but just know, I strongly believe he deserves SO MUCH BETTER. I think my biggest takeaway from Clive's character is that you can think someone has great intentions but sometimes their manipulations get the better of you, and this rings true for poor ol' Clive. Aside from Clive and Milla, Lucy, Justin, Arlo and Chanelle (played by Cobham-Hervey, Mark Coles Smith, Chai Hansen and Dee, respectively) round out the cast rather well, and each has their own stake in Belle's downfall. How to watch Apple Cider Vinegar As someone whose adolescence was spent during this period of social media's true beginnings, it was somewhat delightful to reconnect with some forgotten aspects of what it used to be like. For starters, there's a mention of Hipstamatic, a relic of photography apps past and for me, I geeked out the most at Milla's first job at Girlfriend Magazine, a true icon of the 2010s. There are also quiet nods to Aussie culture during the episodes, too, like squabbles over coffee milk options, the use of the classic red Pawpaw ointment and, of course, the overuse of scarves in outfits. While the show itself has received a [nice 81% rating on Rotten Tomatoes](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/tv/apple_cider_vinegar), if you're a fan of Inventing Anna, or just want to relive [Instagram](https://www.tomsguide.com/tag/instagram)'s glory days, this is the show to binge-watch this weekend. No matter where you live in the world, you can watch all six episodes of [Apple Cider Vinegar on Netflix now](https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8900245/type/dlg/sid/tomsguide-us-4410816965532885467/https://www.netflix.com/au/title/81637595).

Many economies seem to be settling into a lower-rate environment as policymakers look to boost economic growth. That's in stark contrast with the U.S. — it's unclear if the U.S. Federal Reserve would even deliver on its two rate cuts in 2025, forecast in December, given the uncertainties over the economic impact of U.S. President Donald Trump's policies. Ahead of Trump's inauguration, the U.S. dollar began strengthening and hit its highest level in more than two years, as measured by the U.S. dollar index. That's already affected companies such as Amazon, which blamed the currency for weighing down its expected revenue in the current quarter. U.S. exceptionalism might still be in place for now, but an edge can, after all, cut both ways.

All members of the monetary policy committee voted to lower rates, but two out of nine had voted for a larger cut of 50 basis points. Central bank governor Andrew Bailey said he expects more cuts this year. The BOE also halved its growth forecast for the U.K.'s economy in 2025 to 0.75% from 1.5%.

79216488,"Apple's iPhone SE 4 might arrive as soon as next week, according to a new report",It's expected to be a significant upgrade,"Apple's iPhone SE 4 might arrive as soon as next week, according to a new report [News](https://www.techradar.com/news) [Jacob Krol](https://www.techradar.com/author/jacob-krol) It's expected to be a significant upgrade - Bloomberg is reporting that Apple might announce a new iPhone SE as early as next week - The rumored fourth-generation would ditch the home button - It's expected to be a big upgrade with a new design and a processor jump [Apple](https://www.techradar.com/tag/apple) has been rumored to be working on a next-generation [iPhone SE](https://www.techradar.com/news/iphone-se-4) for quite some time. We expect the fourth-generation, more affordable iPhone to arrive sometime in 2025, potentially in the spring, around March or April. However, [a new report from Bloomberg’s Mark Gurman](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-02-06/apple-s-long-awaited-overhaul-of-budget-iphone-nears-release?sref=HrWXCALa) notes that Apple could announce the smartphone as soon as next week. He writes, “The company expects to announce the device as early as next week, ahead of it going on sale later in the month.” That hints at a pretty imminent arrival, but one that likely won’t garner the occasion of an Apple Special Event. It would be more likely to be launched in a matter similar to the iPad Mini from late last year via a press release. The iPhone SE has long been a part of Apple’s iPhone lineup, first arriving in 2016 and last updated as a third generation in 2022. Currently, it most resembles that of an iPhone 8 and is the only smartphone in Apple’s family that still features a home button with Touch ID. However, this next generation of the iPhone SE should be a big leap in terms of looks and the hardware powering it. It’s reported that the fourth-generation iPhone SE will look similar to that of the [iPhone 14](https://www.techradar.com/reviews/iphone-14-review), with a larger, closer-to-the-edge screen design that ditches the home button and features a notch containing Face ID. This means that you’d be able to unlock the iPhone with just a glance, and the same goes for authenticating purchases or using Apple Pay. Gurman’s latest reporting notes that the device is codenamed “V59” and will be the first Apple product to feature a modem designed in-house. That would mean ditching another Qualcomm component for Apple, and the silicon would also be made by the tech giant, with this report noting it would be the A18 chip. That’s the same processor inside the iPhone 16 and 16 Plus, which should make it plenty speedy and, maybe even more important, is the fact that it could handle [Apple Intelligence](https://www.techradar.com/computing/artificial-intelligence/apple-intelligence-explained). This means you’d be able to use ‘Writing Tools,’ create a Genmoji, use Image Playground, and even remove annoying background objects or people from photos with ‘Clean Up.” It would also make it fit for a pretty long shelf life, something that’s become a need for the iPhone SE as it’s only typically refreshed every few years. Along with removing the home button, the iPhone SE fourth-generation will likely make the switch to USB-C. While it’s still available in the United States, it was taken off the shelves and discontinued in the EU, partly in an effort to comply with the rules of ports. When it does arrive, Gurman believes it will be around the same price point of the current model. Right now, the iPhone SE third-generation starts at $429 / £419 / AU$719 and that’s a competitive price for the iPhone lineup, especially considering the iPhone 16 starts at $899. Some [other reports](https://www.techradar.com/phones/iphone/apples-packed-2025-iphone-and-ipad-roadmap-has-just-leaked) have shown that the price could be a bit higher, though.

As far as an arrival as next week, that would kick off Apple’s 2025 product debuts. Also rumored to be arriving next week, as reported by Bloomberg, and the much-anticipated Powerbeats Pro 2 from Beats. [Gurman](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-02-06/apple-s-long-awaited-overhaul-of-budget-iphone-nears-release?sref=HrWXCALa) also notes that a MacBook Air with the M4 chip, a new entry-level iPad, and a new iPad Air should arrive in the first half of 2025. Of course, as with all Apple rumors, nothing's official until the technology giant says it, so we'll see what next week brings.

79216384,"‘Naur, the dingo’s got my baby!’: The best and worst Aussie accents on screen",Kaitlyn Dever nails the Aussie accent in new Netflix drama Apple Cider Vinegar. Her voice coach gives us the expert tips (that many other actors seem to miss).,"‘Naur, the dingo’s got my baby!’: The best and worst Aussie accents on screen By [Nell Geraets](/by/nell-geraets-p5364z) If you were to watch Netflix’s new drama series Apple Cider Vinegar with your eyes closed, you might think its lead actress, Kaitlyn Dever, is a true-blue Aussie. Playing a [“true-ish” version](https://www.smh.com.au/culture/tv-and-radio/apple-cider-vinegar-netflix-creator-interview-belle-gibson-20250127-p5l7hd.html) of wellness scammer Belle Gibson, Dever expertly conceals her American accent, delivering [a ’Strayan performance](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2Yj_rmCzhE) so convincing it matches her actual Australian co-stars Alycia Debnam-Carey and Aisha Dee. Of course, mastering the accent didn’t happen overnight. It required months of training, which she underwent with Melbourne-based voice and dialect coach Jenny Kent. “Kaitlyn has certainly set a new extraordinary benchmark, showing precision and accuracy over six episodes and an enormous amount of dialogue,” she says. Kent has trained many actors throughout her 25-year career, including Dev Patel, Sean Harris and Julia Ormond. No matter who she’s working with, she finds one piece of advice comes up time and time again: less is more. “A good Australian accent is one that an audience doesn’t notice, one that seems effortless,” Kent says. “It takes into account that the vowels can be very simple and not always broad. For example, ‘here’ doesn’t have to turn into ‘hee-yah’, or ‘buy’ doesn’t have to be ‘boy’.” Another top tip is preparation: “Start preparing early. Listen to a wide variety of Australian speakers. Sometimes, the most well-known Australian voices internationally are not always accents widely used or suitable for a particular role.” Nailing the Australian twang is a notoriously tough task for many actors. Dever managed to, but she’s one of a rare few. Let’s take a look at some of the best and worst attempts to date – from the masterfully convincing to the downright embarrassing. Best: Kate Winslet in Holy Smoke! and The Dressmaker We may as well give Kate Winslet citizenship because she has been mastering the Australian accent since 1999. The British actress debuted her Strine (yes, there’s an official word for it) in Jane Campion’s [Holy Smoke!](https://youtu.be/jgFMdjjdJG8), where she played a young Australian woman brought under the influence of a religious guru. Unlike many international actors, she avoids the trap of turning statements into questions. “There’s a common misconception that Australians finish every sentence with a rising intonation,” Kent says. “This ideally should be used very sparingly, if at all.” Winslet then perfected her accent in The Dressmaker (2015), reciting iconic lines like “I’m back, you bastards” as if she’d spent every day of her life in Victoria. Speaking to [Vogue](https://www.vogue.com.au/culture/kate-winslet-on-lee-miller-and-being-a-woman-with-an-opinion/news-story/) last year, she said the best Aussie accent is rather soft, and comes from the back of the throat – both tricks she learned from dialect coach Victoria Mielewska. Best: Dev Patel in Lion Dev Patel has said he [doesn’t have an ear for accents](https://www.smh.com.au/entertainment/celebrity/dev-patel-has-aussie-accent-off-pat-for-feature-film-lion-20161117-gsr7vm.html), but that won’t ring true for anyone who has seen Lion. The British actor delivers some of the strongest accent work in cinematic history in Garth Davis’ 2016 film, occasionally even sounding more Aussie than his co-star Nicole Kidman. According to Kent, who coached Patel for eight months, highly emotional scenes (which are plentiful in Lion) often pose the greatest challenge during accent work. “Australians don’t move their mouths a great deal in speech, so the difficult step can be walking the tightrope of limited movement in the mouth along with freedom and ease of performance. The vowels can be very tricky. Actors can over-shoot a vowel, especially sounds like ‘ay’ in day or late, ‘eye’ in why, might, and ‘ow’ in round or about.” Nevertheless, Patel’s accent only seems to improve when emotionally charged. Best: Caleb Landry Jones in Nitram Speaking of emotional performances, Caleb Landry Jones blew audiences away with his Aussie drawl in Nitram. Despite having a relatively strong Texan twang in his natural voice, Jones was able to convincingly transform into Port Arthur shooter Martin Bryant, largely thanks to three months of voice coaching with Kent. According to Nitram’s director Justin Kurzel, Jones also [watched reruns](https://inreview.com.au/inreview/film/2021/09/29/film-review-nitram/) of shows like Hey Hey It’s Saturday, Neighbours and Home and Away while in quarantine after arriving in the country (the film was made during the pandemic). And while filming, he only spoke with an Australian accent – even when off camera. Like Winslet and Patel, Jones learned that going too “big” would simply result in caricature. The secret is in the subtlety. Worst: Robert Downey jnr in Natural Born Killers In some ways, Robert Downey jnr’s [ridiculously broad accent in Natural Born Killers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qIviHL1X9D4) (1994) suits his over-the-top TV journalist character. His tendency to exaggerate every vowel is almost disguised by his manic energy. However, it ultimately comes across as a bizarre mash-up imitation of Steve Irwin and Crocodile Dundee. Downey jnr somewhat redeemed himself in 2008 when he [briefly reattempted the accent in Tropic Thunder](https://youtu.be/HVsD2YD1Kec?feature=shared&t=60), even if he did sound more Russell Crowe than average Aussie. Worst: John Lithgow in Pitch Perfect 3 Some actors’ voices are simply too iconic to be convincingly transformed. This includes John Lithgow. After all, his lilting American accent is one of the defining elements of 3rd Rock From the Sun. As [Rebel Wilson’s father in Pitch Perfect 3](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S18bIZDSaP8), Lithgow seemingly combines Cockney English, standard British, and (inexplicably) Russian to develop his version of an Australian accent. He falls into the oh-so-common trap of over-extending all ‘e’ and ‘i’ sounds – “fishes” becomes “feeeshes”, Jessica becomes “Jeeeesica”. It’s almost as if he followed the misguided belief that simply pinching your nose while speaking results in perfect Strine. Worst: Kirby Howell-Baptiste in The Good Place There are plenty of non-Australians on TikTok who believe they’ve discovered the perfect strategy to master the Australian accent (the [“R-N-R” trick](https://www.tiktok.com/@paul_ferrante/video/7277739768308370690) is a particularly popular one). There’s just one hitch: they never actually work. Unfortunately, it appears as if Kirby Howell-Baptiste watched a string of those videos as part of her homework for The Good Place. As fun as it is hearing her [say “naur” over and over](https://youtu.be/ofZ2eUyzb0s?feature=shared&t=41), it’s a butchering of the accent. Perhaps we’ve gotten to the point where The Simpsons has [parodied our accent](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81FGVh1dj0A) so many times that non-Australians now simply believe that’s how we sound. Up for debate: Meryl Streep in A Cry in the Dark The [most memorable scene](https://www.nfsa.gov.au/collection/curated/asset/98859-evil-angels-dingos-got-my-baby) in the 1988 thriller A Cry in the Dark (aka Evil Angels) sees Meryl Streep’s character discover her baby has been taken by a dingo, culminating in the iconic (or notorious) line “the dingo’s got my baby”. Though everyone agrees it’s a tense and upsetting scene, few can settle on the effectiveness of Streep’s Strine. Streep defenders argue it’s one of the best examples of accent work to date, especially considering she was playing Lindy Chamberlain – who lived in Australia but was born in New Zealand. A [review from the LA Times](https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1988-11-06-ca-89-story.html) went so far as to describe her accent as “so understated and natural that it’s difficult to believe she wasn’t born within sight of a kangaroo or two”. Others argue her accent was strained – perhaps closer to a South African English accent (words like “backpack”, “six-pack” and “cracked” seem to have that slight twinge typical of Afrikaans). Journalist [Marc Fennell described](https://www.marcfennell.com/marcs-blog/2015/12/5/why-is-the-australian-accent-so-hard) it as “more of an impression than an interpretation”.
