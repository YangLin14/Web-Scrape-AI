79219164,Celtics Quickly Make Good On Brad Stevens' Declaration,"A day after trading Jaden Springer, the Celtics again meet the requirement of having 14 players on standard contracts, signing a player at their primary position of need.","Before the Boston Celtics' hosted the Dallas Mavericks, the franchise's president of basketball operations, Brad Stevens, said the team intended to add a wing to bolster its hopes of lifting the Larry O'Brien Trophy for the second straight year. They'd be the first franchise to do so since the 2017-18 Golden State Warriors. Stevens, who also addressed [the role the sale of the Celtics is having on roster building](https://www.forbes.com/sites/bobbykrivitsk/2025/02/06/brad-stevens-sheds-light-on-the-impact-of-celtics-sale/), quickly made good on his declaration. Boston has signed forward Torrey Craig, [a move first reported](https://x.com/ShamsCharania/status/1887673672862744868) by ESPN's Shams Charania. Craig is a big wing, the Celtics' primary need. The six-foot-seven forward is a two-way player who has shot near or over 40 percent from beyond the arc each of the last three seasons at a volume ranging from 2.9 to 3.9 in the nine games he's played this season. The seven-year veteran is a physical and versatile defender who will also contribute on the boards when called upon. Craig averages 4.0 rebounds per game for his career and grabbed 4.1 per contest in 53 appearances last season. The Chicago Bulls, who at 22-30, occupy the 10th seed, the final spot in the Eastern Conference play-in tournament, recently waived Craig, who has not played since December due to a leg injury. The 34-year-old averaged 6.9 points and 2.8 rebounds in the nine games he suited up for the Bulls this season. The Celtics again meet the requirement of having at least 14 players signed to standard contracts. [They traded Jaden Springer to the Houston Rockets](https://www.forbes.com/sites/bobbykrivitsk/2025/01/31/the-celtics-should-retain-defensive-spark-plug-past-the-trade-deadline/) on Wednesday. The latter has since waived the 22-year-old guard. Boston also sent a 2030 second-round pick and a protected 2027 second-round selection to Houston. In exchange, they received a protected 2031 second-round pick. Before news of the Celtics signing Torrey Craig broke, when asked about the prospect of converting Drew Peterson or JD Davison from a two-way deal to a standard contract, which could still happen since Boston has an open roster spot, Stevens conveyed the following. ""We have 13 guys right now. We'll probably do something with a 14th relatively soon, and then we'll take our time with the 15th and really assess our health and needs and those type of things as we go on. And, (I) won't get into any particular players, (but) I think all of our guys have done a great job. It will be more based on the needs of the Celtics.""",forbes.com,https://www.forbes.com/sites/bobbykrivitsk/2025/02/06/celtics-quickly-make-good-on-brad-stevens-declaration/,[],"['Boston Celtics', 'Brad Stevens', 'Chicago Bulls', 'Drew Peterson', 'Houston Rockets', 'Jaden Springer', 'Jd Davison']",2025-02-07,2025-02-07,0,7,54,170,2636

In this article, we are going to take a look at where The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS) stands against the other stocks Jim Cramer recently talked about. Jim Cramer, the host of Mad Money, took a moment on Wednesday to reflect on the latest market developments as earnings season progresses, sharing his thoughts on how investors can identify stocks that are unfairly punished and present solid buying opportunities. “This market has the memory of a mayfly that creates a ton of opportunities so… I want to help you find them.” READ ALSO [Jim Cramer Shed Light on These 8 Stocks Recently](https://www.insidermonkey.com/blog/jim-cramer-shed-light-on-these-8-stocks-recently-1443733/) and [12 Stocks on Jim Cramer’s Radar](https://www.insidermonkey.com/blog/12-stocks-on-jim-cramers-radar-1442931/) Cramer stressed that time and again, he has seen growth stocks severely impacted by minor bits of bad news, such as small downgrades or slight concerns about a quarter’s performance. In these cases, he noted, the punishment rarely fits the crime, if a real issue even exists. Cramer also recently weighed in on the ongoing trade tensions with China. He urged Wall Street to start taking President Trump’s policies more seriously, pointing out that Trump had negotiated a deal that granted China a much lower tariff than Canada received. Cramer dismissed the idea that China’s response was an equal counterattack, calling such a notion “nonsense” and “idiocy.” He added: “Now, if Wall Street took Trump seriously, they’d know that China played softball with its retaliation just like Trump played softball with that 10% tariff.” He elaborated that much of the recent panic, which had escalated on Sunday night, shifted a bit to optimism, as people began to realize that the president had managed to negotiate a deal. Acknowledging the presence of hardliners within the White House who are keen on taking a tougher stance on China, Cramer noted that those individuals had lost the battle. He pointed out that Trump’s objective was to broker a deal that could generate revenue for the U.S. Treasury while providing American businesses with opportunities in China. Cramer emphasized that this goal should have been clear to anyone who had been watching the Chinese stock market, as stocks that trade in China surged recently. Our Methodology For this article, we compiled a list of 13 stocks that were discussed by Jim Cramer during the episode of Mad Money on February 5. We listed the stocks in the order that Cramer mentioned them. We also provided hedge fund sentiment for each stock as of the third quarter of 2024, which was taken from Insider Monkey’s database of 900 hedge funds. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points ([see more details here](https://www.insidermonkey.com/premium/newsletters/quarterly)). The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:[DIS](https://www.insidermonkey.com/insider-trading/company/walt%20disney%20co/1744489/)) Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 76 Starting his list of solid buying opportunities in the stock market these days, Cramer mentioned The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS) and said: “This morning, for instance, Disney reported. It was a terrific quarter, theme parks, much better than expected, movies, fantastic, TV sports, real positive but there was this one line involving Disney’s streaming property. When it raised prices, there were some churn and subscribers dropped by 1%. Oh no, the genius traders said to themselves, Netflix had no churn when it raised prices, so let’s bury this stock. These wise men and women sold Disney down into oblivion, not thinking about two things. One, Netflix is a beast, the best of the best without compare. And two, Netflix doesn’t have parks or cruise ships or even a fraction of Disney’s intellectual property. I bet that in a few weeks, people will forget why they sold Disney stock down, and the stock, it will be higher.” The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS) manages a wide range of businesses, including film and TV production, streaming services, and theme park operations. Cramer has been bullish on the stock for some time and in January, he commented: “Disney, I turned to Jeff Marks today, it was at $106, I said, when should we buy back that stock that we sold much higher? I think you got a great price today. I think Disney is a remarkable company and people are selling it because of the fires in Los Angeles. I feel horrible about what’s happening in Los Angeles, but I do not think the franchise of Disney is gonna be down for long very much.” Overall DIS ranks 1st on our list of the stocks Jim Cramer highlighted recently. While we acknowledge the potential of DIS as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

No cuts have been made to the aid agency as of this writing. However, the [New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/live/2025/02/06/us/president-trump-news/usaid-job-cuts?smid=url-share) reports that the Trump administration hopes to keep just 290 or so of the agency's staffers after downsizing. [USAID](https://www.salon.com/topic/usaid) currently employs more than 10,000 workers coordinating U.S. global aid efforts. USAID Assistant Administrator Atul Gawande shared an email that appeared to be from acting USAID Deputy Chief of Staff Joel Borkert on social media. A chart within the email seemed to corroborate the Times’ claims of massive staffing cuts. Gawande slammed potential mass layoffs in a series of social media posts, saying that the Trump admin's ""utter indifference"" to the consequences of their actions is ""evil."" “These people worked selflessly for their country in some of Earth's most impoverished or dangerous places under GOP and Dems alike,” he wrote. “The utter indifference to loss of life, our people abroad, America's standing, and American security, caused by unchecked, reckless power, is evil.” Trump officials have launched multiple assaults on the agency behind crucial and popular global civilian aid initiatives in the opening days of the new administration. Late last month, the State Department froze most international aid funding indefinitely, as billionaire and Department of Government Efficiency head [Elon Musk](https://www.salon.com/topic/elon_musk) claimed the department needed to be shut down. In [an interview](https://x.com/WesternLensman/status/1886602412485697753) with Fox News, Secretary of State [Marco Rubio](http://salon.com/topic/marco_rubio) alleged that employees at USAID were “completely uncooperative” with the administration’s planned changes to the agency. “The goal was to reform it, but now we have rank insubordination,” Rubio said on Monday. “We had no choice but to take dramatic steps to bring this thing under control.” On Thursday evening, the American Federation of Government Employees and American Foreign Service Association sued to stop the USAID cuts, calling actions to “systematically dismantle” the agency “unconstitutional and illegal.” “They have cost thousands of American jobs. And they have imperiled U.S. national security interests,” [the complaint](https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.dcd.277213/gov.uscourts.dcd.277213.1.0.pdf) alleges. “Not a single one of defendants’ actions to dismantle USAID were taken pursuant to congressional authorization.” Read more about this topic",salon.com,https://www.salon.com/2025/02/06/this-is-evil-usaid-will-reportedly-be-gutted-by-administration/,[],"['All Salon', 'Doge', 'Donald Trump', 'Elon Musk', 'In Brief', 'Marco Rubio', 'News &Amp', 'Politics', 'Tiingo Top', 'Usaid']",2025-02-07,2025-02-07,0,10,71,108,2979

Some are doubling down and paying up, while others are plotting their escape. Despite an unhappy VMware customer base, Broadcom is thriving. In its most [recent earnings](https://investors.broadcom.com/news-releases/news-release-details/broadcom-inc-announces-fourth-quarter-and-fiscal-year-2024), the company posted record revenues of $51.6 billion, with $2.7 billion coming from software sales. Broadcom is betting that, despite rising costs, enterprises will still choose VMware over competing solutions. However, that gamble is far from certain, with mounting competition from alternative hypervisors, open-source platforms, and public-cloud specific solutions. For enterprises navigating this uncertainty, the challenge isn’t just finding a replacement for VMware. IT shops of all sizes see Broadcom’s actions as an opportunity to rethink their approach to virtualization, cloud strategy, and IT modernization. The Growing Demand for VMware Alternatives For many VMware customers, the shift isn’t just about cost — it’s about risk. Broadcom’s moves over the past year have raised concerns among IT leaders that they may soon face fewer choices and diminishing support. Recent high-profile migrations and analyst recommendations highlight the growing demand for alternatives: - Rackspace is testing a [migration](https://www.theregister.com/2025/02/05/rackspace_vmware_planet9_migration/)of 3,000 VMs away from VMware to explore whether an alternative private cloud solution can replace it. - Beeks Group has begun moving more than 20,000 virtual machines away from VMware, citing a [tenfold increase](https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2024/12/company-claims-1000-percent-price-hike-drove-it-from-vmware-to-open-source-rival/)in its VMware license renewal costs as a key motivator. - Gartner [warns](https://www.networkworld.com/article/3813523/thinking-of-moving-off-vmware-gartner-tallies-cost-of-large-scale-vmware-migration.html#:~:text=Gartner%20analysis%20shows%20the%20cost,other%20operational%20expenses%20are%20calculated.)that migration won’t be easy—or cheap—but it may be the only viable move for organizations wary of long-term uncertainty. These are not isolated cases. Search interest in “VMware alternatives” has surged, and analyst firms are fielding more inquiries from businesses evaluating migration strategies. Recent urveys from Civo and CloudBold indicate that over half of VMware customers are actively exploring alternative solutions. The biggest drivers are rising costs, restrictive licensing, and the fear of vendor lock-in under Broadcom's control. However, moving away from VMware is no simple task. Enterprises must weigh migration complexity, integration challenges, and the long-term viability of their chosen alternative. The decision isn’t just about cost savings — it’s about aligning IT strategy with the future of hybrid cloud, containerization, and AI-driven workloads. Top Alternatives to VMware Not every VMware customer needs to migrate, and those satisfied with Broadcom’s platform may opt to stay. However, for organizations exploring alternatives, several strong contenders offer unique advantages: - Public Cloud Providers: CSPs like AWS, Microsoft Azure, and Google Cloud all offer scalability and automation but come with vendor lock-in risks and migration complexity. They are best suited for organizations prioritizing cloud-native modernization over traditional virtualization. - Microsoft Hyper-V & Azure Stack HCI: These are ideal for businesses already invested in the Microsoft ecosystem. However, Hyper-V's feature set does not fully match VMware's, and Azure Stack HCI's hardware requirements may be a limiting factor. - Red Hat OpenShift Virtualization: Appeals to organizations embracing containers and Kubernetes. While powerful, the learning curve and migration complexity may deter traditional virtualization users. - Nutanix Cloud Infrastructure: The closest direct alternative to VMware, Nutanix provides a salutation based on a hyperconverged architecture that simplifies migration and hybrid-cloud operations. Its support for both traditional and modern IT architectures, along with [deep collaborations](https://nand-research.com/research-note-dell-nutanix-expand-relationship-offerings/)with OEMs like Dell Technologies, make it a preferred choice for enterprises seeking a smooth transition and future-proof investment. Unlike past IT disruptions, where a single dominant player emerged, this transition may lead to a more diversified market, with different solutions catering to specific business needs. Analyst’s Take VMware dominated enterprise virtualization for years, deeply embedding itself into IT operations. While hybrid cloud, containerization, and AI-driven workloads had already begun to challenge VMware’s stronghold, inertia and familiarity kept enterprises loyal. Now, financial and operational uncertainty is forcing a shift. Organizations are no longer just considering alternatives—they’re actively adopting them. This is not merely a reaction to cost increases but a fundamental change in enterprise IT priorities. Broadcom’s strategy has accelerated an existing trend: the growing emphasis on strategic flexibility and multi-cloud readiness. For IT leaders, remaining on VMware without reassessment carries significant risk. Broadcom has made it clear that revenue optimization takes precedence over customer satisfaction. If this trend continues, enterprises that fail to develop an exit strategy may be locked into an increasingly costly and restrictive environment. That said, enterprises have more options than ever before. Organizations must carefully evaluate their next steps, whether moving to the public cloud, adopting a hybrid model, transitioning to a new hypervisor, or staying with VMware. This shift is already creating winners. Nutanix, Microsoft Hyper-V, Azure Stack HCI, and Red Hat OpenShift Virtualization are emerging as viable competitors. Each of these offer distinct advantages based on business needs and strategic direction, with Nutanix leading the pack. The time to act is now. Enterprises that proactively navigate this transition will mitigate the uncertainties of VMware's new ownership and position themselves for long-term success. The primary job of any IT organization, after all, is minimizing risk while providing the infrastructure for digital transformation.

Der PPS-Abfall wird als Rohstoff für die Herstellung von DURAFIDE (R) rG-PPS verwendet, das noch in diesem Jahr auf den Markt kommen soll. In den ersten Prozessen werden strenge Abnahmekontrollen durchgeführt und Metall entfernt. In nachfolgenden Prozessen werden Recyclingmaterialien und einige neue Materialien neu formuliert, um die Zielspezifikationen zu erfüllen. Für die Materialien gelten die gleichen Qualitätsstandards wie für neue Materialien. Die offene PIR-Regelung wird den Kunden helfen, Abfälle zu reduzieren und effektiv zu nutzen und auch die Kohlenstoffemissionen ihrer Produkte deutlich zu verringern. Vorerst wird das Rohmaterial der Kunden aus bestimmten Typen von DURAFIDE (R) glasverstärktem PPS bestehen.

The [Cincinnati Bengals](https://sportsdata.usatoday.com/football/nfl/teams/cincinnati-bengals/327) quarterback won the NFL Comeback Player of the Year award on Thursday at NFL Honors. He is only the second player to ever win the award twice after Chad Pennington did so with the New York Jets in 2006 and Miami Dolphins in 2008. Burrow beat out Minnesota Vikings quarterback Sam Darnold as well as Los Angeles Chargers running back J.K. Dobbins, New England Patriots cornerback Christian Gonzalez and Buffalo Bills safety Damar Hamlin. Burrow led the NFL in passing yards (4,918) and passing touchdowns (43) this season after missing the final seven games of the 2023 campaign with a torn ligament in his wrist. He became the third quarterback to have at least 4,500 passing yards, 40 passing touchdowns and fewer than 10 interceptions, joining Tom Brady in 2007 and Aaron Rodgers in 2011. Despite mounting a late push for the playoffs by ending the season on a five-game win streak, Cincinnati fell short of the postseason for the second consecutive year when it didn't land the help it needed from other teams to clinch a wild-card berth.

79219117,"Case Against Dadasaheb Phalke International Film Festival Organisers For ""Fraud""",The Mumbai Police have charged the organizers of the Dadasaheb Phalke International Film Festival with allegedly claiming the Centre's support to hold the event and deceiving various state governments.,"The Mumbai Police have registered a case against organisers of the Dadasaheb Phalke International Film Festival (DPIFF) for allegedly claiming the Centre's support to hold the event and deceiving various state governments and entities like Punjab National Bank, Cinepolis and PVR Inox for sponsorship. The organisers, including DPIFF founder and Managing Director Anil Mishra, also allegedly sold awards in the name of Dadasaheb Phalke - known as the ""Father of Indian Cinema"" - to several actors, including those whose films were commercially unsuccessful, police sources said. The accused also cited the participation of prominent Bollywood actors and reportedly took Rs 2.5 lakh for a pass (that would permit two people) for the event that is scheduled to be held at Taj Lands End in the upscale Bandra area of Mumbai on February 19 and 20. The DPIFF is the country's only independent global film fest and the most prestigious cinematic celebration that honours the legacy of Dadasaheb Phalke, according to information available on its website. To be sure, the awards distributed in the event are different from the one given by the President of India as part of the National Film Awards. There was no immediate comment from the organisers of the DPIFF till the time of filing this report. The police sources said a First Information Report (FIR) against Mr Mishra - a former member of the Central Board of Film Certification, his wife Parvati Mishra and their son Abhishek Mishra, among others, was registered for falsely claiming the support of prominent political leaders like Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Union Home Minister Amit Shah to make the event appear credible. The organisers also claimed that the event seeks to promote the ""Incredible India"" campaign, an international tourism campaign launched by the Ministry of Tourism in 2002 to portray India as a tourist destination. Besides, the organisers tried to portray the event as part of the ""Dadasaheb Phalke Lifetime Achievement Award"" that is presented by the President of India. Mr Anil Mishra, the sources said, used letters of good wishes purportedly written by Prime Minister Modi, Mr Shah, Tourism Minister Dharmendra Pradhan and former Prime Minister Manmohan Singh to promote the event. The accused allegedly collected sponsorship from government and semi-government institutions. He collected money from the tourism department of the states of Uttar Pradesh, Rajasthan, Gujarat, Punjab and Maharashtra, Punjab National Bank, the State Bank of India and Life Insurance Corporation. The organisers also targeted Haldirams, Acer, Cinepolis, PVR Inox and Senco among others. Mr Mishra also collected money from actors, whose films were commercially unsuccessful, in exchange for an award, the sources said. Moreover, the company - International Tourism Festival Private Limited - under whose name he obtained the sponsorship has been shut down, the sources added. The case was filed on the basis of a complaint by Sameer Dixit, who is the Maharashtra president of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)'s Chitrapat Kamgar Aghadi that claims to support artists, technicians and workers of the film, television and digital industry. ""When we tried to dig up information on the film festival, we learnt that the organisers tried to make the event appear as though it was government-supported. They also used the Prime Minister's Office and names of ministers as a reference to promote the event and misguide the people. They also said the festival seeks to promote the 'Incredible India' tourism campaign. They took sponsorship from public sector units like Punjab Tourism and Uttarakhand Tourism and Punjab National Bank. We have gathered all the evidence and given them to the police,"" Mr Dixit said. The organisers have been charged under sections 318 (4) - deals with cheating and fraud - and 319 (2) - punishment for the crime - of the Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita and a probe is underway, the police sources said.

It is related to the Proto-Germanic ""swathō"" (track, footprint) and is linked to the verb ""swithan"" (to sweep, smooth). Over time, the meaning narrowed to refer specifically to the area cut by a scythe or mower, and later, it evolved into a more figurative sense of a broad strip or expanse.

79219103,Omega Healthcare Investors (OHI) Q4 2024 Earnings Call Transcript,"OHI earnings call for the period ending December 31, 2024.","Omega Healthcare Investors ([OHI](/quote/nyse/ohi/) -0.68%) Q4 2024 Earnings Call Feb 06, 2025, 10:00 a.m. ET Contents: - Prepared Remarks - Questions and Answers - Call Participants Prepared Remarks: Operator Thank you for standing by. My name is Kate, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Omega Healthcare Investors fourth quarter earnings conference call. [Operator instructions] I would now like to turn the call over to Michele Reber. Please go ahead. Michele Reber -- Senior Director, Asset Management Thank you, and good morning. With me today is Omega's CEO, Taylor Pickett, president, Matthew Gourmand, CFO, Bob Stephenson, CIO, Vikas Gupta, and Megan Krull, senior vice president of operations. Comments made during this conference call that are not historical facts may be forward-looking statements such as statements regarding our financial projections, potential transactions, operator prospects and outlook generally. Factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements are detailed in the company's filings with the SEC. During the call today, we will refer to some GAAP financial measures, such as NAREIT FFO, adjusted FFO, FAD and EBITDA. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to the most comparable measure under generally accepted accounting principles are available in the quarterly supplement. In addition, certain operator coverage and financial information that we discuss is based on data provided by our operators that has not been independently verified by Omega. I will now turn the call over to Taylor. Taylor C. Pickett -- Chief Executive Officer Thanks, Michele. Good morning, and thank you for joining our fourth quarter 2024 earnings conference call. Today, I will discuss our fourth quarter financial results, management changes and certain key operating trends. Fourth quarter FAD, funds available for distribution of $0.70 per share reflects continued revenue and EBITDA growth, which has allowed us to reduce leverage to below 4.0x debt-to-EBITDA while continuing to deliver FAD growth in 2024. Our 2025 AFFO guidance is $2.90 per share to $2.98 per share which reflects the first quarter 2025 dilutive impact of our significant fourth quarter share issuances, offset by escalators and other opportunities throughout 2025. We recently announced management changes with Matthew Gourmand named president, and Vikas Gupta, named chief investment officer. I am extremely confident in their ability to lead our exceptional team in the upcoming years. I would also like to thank Dan Booth. I had the opportunity to work with Dan for over 30 years, 23 years here at Omega. Dan's many contributions to Omega are an important driver of Omega's outperformance of not only other healthcare REITs, but all REITs over the last 23 years. Lastly in 2024, the team did a great job staying disciplined while forcing and closing 36 transactions, deploying approximately $1.1 billion in capital. The 2025 acquisition pipeline remains active. I will now turn the call over to Bob. Robert O. Stephenson -- Chief Financial Officer Thanks, Taylor, and good morning. Turning to our financials for the fourth quarter. Revenue for the fourth quarter was $279 million compared to $239 million for the fourth quarter of 2023. The year-over-year increase is primarily the result of the timing and impact of revenue from new investments completed throughout 2024, operator restructurings and transitions, partially offset by asset sales completed during that same time period. Our NAREIT FFO for the fourth quarter was $196 million or $0.68 per share as compared to $129 million or $0.50 per share for the fourth quarter of 2023. Our adjusted FFO was $214 million or $0.74 per share for the quarter and our FAD was $202 million or $0.70 per share and both exclude several items outlined in our NAREIT FFO, adjusted FFO and FAD reconciliations to net income found in our earnings release, as well as our fourth quarter financial supplemental posted to our website. Our Q4 FAD was just under $0.005 greater than our Q3 FAD, which is impressive. If you remember, in Q3, we issued 14 million shares for $530 million in gross proceeds at an average price of $37.32 per share. These 14 million shares issued at the end of the third quarter were not fully included within the weighted average third quarter share count. As outlined in our earnings press release, during the fourth quarter, we completed $340 million of new investments and funded the investments through the issuance of an additional 11 million shares of equity for gross proceeds totaling $438 million at an average price of $40.19 per share. Our balance sheet remained strong at year-end as we ended the year with over $500 million in cash that was used to repay a $400 million bond on January 15, 2025. We ended the month of January with over $240 million in cash, the full borrowing capacity of our $1.45 billion credit facility, and approximately $820 million available under our ATM program all ready to deploy as needed in new investments. As long as our equity currency remains favorable, we will continue to prefund investments by issuing equity. At December 31, 95% of our $4.9 billion in debt was at fixed rates. And our fixed charge coverage ratio was 4.7 times and our net funded debt to annualized adjusted normalized EBITDA was 3.96 times, which is the lowest our leverage has been in 10 years. We still have a target leverage range between four to five times with the sweet spot being between 4.5 to 4.75 times. As we continue to fund acquisitions accretively with equity, we position ourselves for outsized AFFO growth once we decided to reenter the bond market. As Taylor mentioned, we provided our full year adjusted FFO guidance of a range between $2.90 to $2.98 per share. A few of the key 2025 guidance assumptions are, we're assuming no change in our revenue related to operators on an accrual basis of revenue recognition. As a note, over 75% of our operators are currently on a straight-line basis of accounting, which meets any growth in revenue through annual escalators will not yield further growth in adjusted FFO but growth in cash flow. We're assuming Maplewood's ability to pay contractual rent continues to improve. Of the $260 million in mortgages and other real estate-backed investments contractually maturing in 2025, $124 million will convert from loans to fee simple real estate and $28 million will be repaid throughout 2025. We are assuming the balance of the loans will be extended beyond 2025. We're assuming $56 million in asset sales related to assets classified as held for sale, which we recorded $1.9 million of revenue in the fourth quarter. We've included the impact of new investments completed as of February 5. We project our quarterly G&A expense to run between $12 million to $14 million in 2025 with the first quarter typically being the highest quarter. We assume we will repay our $230 million of secured debt in November 2025. We assume no material changes in market interest rates as they relate to either interest earned on balance sheet cash or interest expense charge on credit facility borrowings. Finally, consistent with how we ended 2024, we assume we will position ourselves with enough cash on the balance sheet by the end of 2025 to repay our January 2026, $600 million bond maturity. As a reminder, to the extent our equity currency remains favorable, and we continue to prefund investments, or prepare for debt maturities for every 4 million shares issued, assuming shares are issued at prices consistent with 2024 or quarterly adjusted FFO is negatively impacted by slightly less than $0.01 per share, while our leverage improves or it was reduced by approximately 0.15x until the cash is put back to work in new investments. Our 2025 adjusted FFO guidance does not include any additional investments or asset sales, as well as any additional capital transactions other than what I just mentioned or what was included in the earnings release. I will now turn the call over to Vikas. Vikas Gupta -- Chief Investment Officer Thank you, Bob, and good morning, everyone. Today, we'll be discussing the most recent performance trends for Omega's operating portfolio and Omega's investment activity in 2024 and share insight into Omega's piping for 2025. Turning to portfolio performance. Trailing 12-month operator EBITDAR coverage for our core portfolio as of September 30, 2024, increased to 1.5 times versus 1.49 times for the trailing 12-month period ended June 30, 2024. We want to highlight that the most recent quarter's performance is a continuation of trailing 12-month coverage improvement across our portfolio over the past year. These ongoing improvements were reflective of the strength and expertise of Omega's operating partners, the resolution or nearly all of Omega's portfolio restructurings over recent years, and the disciplined allocation of new investment capital over the past year. Despite continued pressures from suboptimal labor and reimbursement levels in select markets, the industry landscape continues to improve as a result of the growing aging population and our operators' ability to serve an increasingly complex resident population. However, with occupancy now approaching pre-COVID levels, we would expect any future coverage increases to be more modest. As of today, the only major operator, Omega is engaged in restructuring activity with is Levi. Levi continues to work toward exiting bankruptcy in the second quarter of 2025 but the effective date of such exit is conditioned upon the rulings on pending motions before the bankruptcy court. In the interim, Omega expects to continue to receive full contractual rent of $3.1 million per month or $37.5 million per annum. Turning to new investments. As Taylor previously mentioned, Omega's transaction pipeline in 2024 was very strong with over $1.1 billion in new investments. These transactions varied in size and nature and demonstrate Omega's ability to adapt to the evolving investment landscape in the long-term care industry. In 2004, we continue to support the growth of our existing and new operators by focusing on strong credit-backed real estate investments and real estate loans with exceptional returns that often provide Omega with the ultimate opportunity for real estate ownership. Specifically, of the approximately $359 million or 31% of Omega's new investments in 2024 that were real estate loans, over $124 million or one-third of those loans provide Omega with the opportunity to acquire the underlying real estate upon maturity with long-term triple net lease structures already negotiated. The balance of new real estate loans made in 2024 supported existing operator relationships or facilitated our borrowers acquisitions of distressed assets at prices well below replacement costs. Also, the UK was a large driver of our 2024 new investments, totaling over $782 million or 68% of our total new investments. We have been investing in the UK for over a decade now and have accumulated a strong bench of operators and other relationships there, which lead us to highly accretive investment opportunities. Looking at the fourth quarter of 2024, Omega completed a total of $363 million in new investments, inclusive of $23 million in capex. The new investments include $179 million in real estate acquisitions across four transactions which have an average initial annual cash yield of 9.9% and $162 million real estate loans which have a weighted average interest rate of 10.9%. A large portion of these new real estate loans, $101 million or 62% provide Omega with the opportunity to acquire the underlying real estate upon maturity. Subsequent to the fourth quarter of 2024, Omega closed on $26 million in new investments, excluding capex. These investments include a $10.6 million acquisition of two facilities with an initial cash yield of 9.9% via a new lease with a new operator and a $15.4 million mortgage to an existing operator for two facilities with an 11% interest rate. Turning to the pipeline. Omega's pipeline and transaction outlook for 2025 continues to be quite healthy. We continue to see marketed opportunities both in the US and the UK, while also benefiting from off-market opportunities that our existing operating partners and other relationships bring us. Based on the current lending environment, it is our expectation that we will continue to receive inquiries for real estate loans while we continue to evaluate and engage in select loan opportunities, primarily for existing operator relationships, our priority will always be to allocate capital toward accretive owned real estate deals to grow our balance sheet. So I'll now turn the call over to Megan. Megan Krull -- Senior Vice President, Operations Thanks, Vikas, and good morning, everyone. As with the start of any new administration, there are a lot of unknowns before us. And while it is too soon to tell what lies ahead, there are many reasons to feel secure about where we currently stand. As Vikas mentioned, coverages are the strongest they've been in years, which is reflective of the continuing recovery from the pandemic. The industry still grapples with the overhang of many issues, most notably staffing shortages, but for now, things appear relatively stable. While the Trump agenda specifically calls entitlement reform into the forefront of potential policy changes, we also know that President Trump supported this industry with government aid when it was the most critical during COVID. We hope that understanding of the importance of this industry hasn't been lost. We continue to monitor the various efforts against the staffing mandate. As I noted last quarter, a motion for summary judgment was filed in the federal court case in the state of Texas brought by certain industry associations among others, which we still hear could be decided as early as the end of this quarter or early next quarter. While the 20 attorneys general who filed suit against the mandate in Federal Court in Iowa lost their plea for preliminary injunction, their case continues moving forward as well. Irrespective of the court cases, a legislative repeal is still very much a possibility given that the reversal of the rule would stand to save the federal government $22 billion over 10 years according to the Congressional Budget Office. We are still very hopeful that the rule will ultimately be overturned, and we hope that any future rule-making surrounding reimbursement or regulation is done so with an even hand and an understanding of what is truly at stake. I will now open the call up for questions. Questions & Answers: Operator [Operator instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Jonathan Hughes with Raymond James. Please go ahead. Jonathan Hughes -- Analyst Hi, good morning. Thanks for the prepared remarks and commentary, and congrats to Matthew and Vikas on their new roles and Dan on a great career. Vikas, I was hoping you could share some more details of what the investment pipeline looks like today in terms of dollar size yields and then fee simple acquisitions versus loans. Vikas Gupta -- Chief Investment Officer Yes. Thanks, Jonathan. So the pipeline, as I said in my prepared remarks, looks strong. It's a little bit more heavily weighted right now in the UK, but that can change as things progress. And we're mostly looking at small midsized deals at this time. A bit more real estate focused, which we're just going to continue to pursue more than loans at this time. But again, all of that can change as things play out. Jonathan Hughes -- Analyst OK. And I think I heard in maybe Bob's prepared remarks, there are some loans that are converting to fee simple ownership this year. Was that always the plan for those? Or were those operators hopeful to refi and due to the challenging lending environment, this is kind of the option that they're locked with? Vikas Gupta -- Chief Investment Officer Yes, Jonathan, this is Vikas again. So we did a few loans last year knowing that they would convert to leases. And that was done primarily due to regulatory timing in the UK It takes a long time to get those approvals in the UK So we structure loans so our operators, borrowers could get the deals done. And then,, the terms are short, they're all within this year, they'll convert the leases -- real estate leases. Operator Your next question comes from the line of Michael Griffin with Citi. Please go ahead. Michael Griffin -- Citi -- Analyst Appreciate the color kind of on the regulatory front and the potential implications of the new administration. Just wondering if you could give any insight into kind of the labor environment and demand there that your operators are seeing? And is there any worry that potential immigration reform could impact the labor pool and maybe further pressure wages? Megan Krull -- Senior Vice President, Operations Yes. I mean, look, the labor environment is still tough, especially in the more rural areas and that is probably going to be -- continue to be tough for a long time unless something changes. And so, the immigration policy is definitely going to play into that to the extent that we can legally bring in immigrants to supplement the nursing force that helps and we'll just have to wait to see how that all progresses, but we haven't seen any impact from the immigration policies at this time. Michael Griffin -- Citi -- Analyst That's helpful. And then, maybe a question for Vikas just getting back to the acquisition pipeline and the opportunity set. There's been some news over the past couple of months just around SNF operators and maybe financial and tenant health is coming more into the focus. I'm curious if you've seen more scrutiny on underwriting prospective deals, whether it's from a rent coverage perspective, just given maybe there could be some potential issues or worries around operator health. Again, it seems like it's more idiosyncratic to certain tenants to certain operators. But have you seen it change in kind of underwriting from that perspective? Vikas Gupta -- Chief Investment Officer No, we really haven't. We continue to underwrite where we have historically credit-based deals with strong operators and I think I agree with your point. It is more idiosyncratic. Operator Your next question comes from the line of John Kilichowski with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead. John Kilichowski -- Analyst Thank you. Maybe I'll just follow up very quickly on one more on the pipeline. Maybe could you talk more about the competitive landscape today and your expectation around going in yields? Vikas Gupta -- Chief Investment Officer Yes. I mean, we aren't seeing a big change in competitive environment. I mean there are family offices, private investors, both in the US and the UK. We're seeing less competition in the UK right now due to lack of capital there. But otherwise, we're not seeing a big change in competition. As for yields, we're staying where we've always stayed, close to 10%, and we're able to deploy capital there. John Kilichowski -- Analyst Understood. And then, maybe one for Bob here. Just on balance sheet fortification. Your leverage is at four times long-term target of four to five times. So not a pressing need to deleverage here. But according to the guide, there's going to be some material equity issuance here to delever in the back half or '26 maturity. One, could you kind of give us the guide for what that number is, obviously, ex any acquisition activity and then maybe more your thoughts about the decision to firm up the balance sheet at the expense of maybe some incremental dilution here? And what are you looking at? Is that the relative spread of your AFFO yield to the current cost of 10-year paper versus what it's been historically? Robert O. Stephenson -- Chief Financial Officer That's a correct statement, what you just said. So they hit a couple of -- there were a couple of questions in there. So we're going to treat the guidance similar to what we did in '24, be prepared to handle that debt maturity coming due in '26, similar to what we did for the one we just paid off. Given our cost of equity right now, we're taking advantage that we'll be opportunistic. The guidance does not have future acquisitions in. But in order to get the $600 million, you need to issue the equity there. But we will be opportunistic if the bond market turns around and we can issue bonds, we'll do that. I mean we've always been in a position to readily hit either the equity or bond market. Operator Your next question comes from the line of Juan Sanabria with BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead. Juan C. Sanabria -- Analyst Hi, Good morning. Just following up there on that same line of questioning. What share count, I guess, is assumed or how much equity is assumed to raise as part of guidance to pay maturing loans booked this year and then to prep for the '26 Jan maturity you referenced? Robert O. Stephenson -- Chief Financial Officer We give out the exact share count on, but it's really going to be -- to get to the $600 million, the share count is going to be driven by the price and the timing that I issue that equity to get to $600 million. So the price is high, less equity needed that's outside of the guidance and if the price goes down from where we are today or historically, what we had in the third and fourth quarter and it still accretive to do it that way, we fund it, and we'll be at the lower end of the guidance. Juan C. Sanabria -- Analyst OK. And you're assuming other remaining 25 debt maturities are also repaid with cash/equity. Is that correct, just to make sure? Robert O. Stephenson -- Chief Financial Officer That's correct. Yes. Operator Your next question comes from the line of Nick Yulico with Scotiabank. Please go ahead. Nicholas Yulico -- Analyst Couple of questions just on Maplewood and then the Guardian transition assets. If you could just give us a feel for kind of where you're at in terms of getting back to sort of a maximum rent on those operators. And I guess, specifically on Maplewood, as we think about the Second Avenue asset, how that maybe an update on how that occupancy is trending and how important that is to get back to the full Maplewood rent? Vikas Gupta -- Chief Investment Officer Yes. Nick, this is Vikas here. So on Maplewood, our total portfolio's occupancy is now at 91%. That includes Second Avenue. And Second Avenue itself is at 85%. So things are looking good there for our core portfolio with Maplewood. They paid strong rent in January, and we feel like that rent is sustainable, if not, will go up as occupancy increases in the second half so overall we feel very good about Maplewood at the moment. For Guardian, that transition happened last year to a new operator, they hit their high threshold of rent, and we will just see what happens in the future. But right now, everything is going as planned. Nicholas Yulico -- Analyst OK. And then, just to be clear, the guidance for the year assumes that it's just both those operators pay existing rent that they're paying that they're not paying a higher level? Robert O. Stephenson -- Chief Financial Officer That is correct. If Maplewood is at the higher level, that's one component that takes us to our higher end of our guidance. Operator Your next question comes from the line of Farrell Granath with Bank of America. Please go ahead. Farrell Granath -- Analyst I wanted to touch on the EBITDAR coverage. I know that you made the comment that the increases may be a little bit more modest going forward. But can you go through a little bit of the moving pieces and maybe how that's looking if it wasn't a trailing four quarters, specifically one tying in, I also see the less than 1x coverage had a larger ding on a small rent percentage? Megan Krull -- Senior Vice President, Operations Yes. I mean in terms of that one operator under one times, that's a one facility deal that we acquired as part of a larger transaction. It's not a typical asset cost for us. It's not a SNF. It's not an ALF. It's a specialty hospital, and they have very volatile earnings so they bounce all around. So that I don't think is indicative of anything that you would expect to see in the rest of the portfolio. We continue to see a good performance from the rest of our portfolio and continuing to see everything moderate and be strong. Farrell Granath -- Analyst Great. And also on that mix, I also saw the -- there's a slight uptick in the private insurers kind of a larger one than I've seen in the last couple of quarters. I was curious what was driving that? Are you seeing the payer mix shifting more toward private? Megan Krull -- Senior Vice President, Operations It's just highly dependent on the deals that we do. So as we do more UK deals that private pay is going to come up a bit. Operator Your next question comes from the line of Michael Carroll with RBC Capital Markets. Michael Carroll -- Analyst I wanted to circle back to Maplewood. I mean how is Maplewood positioned today? I mean, are they better positioned to really ramp up their EBITDAR now versus the beginning of 2024. I mean if you look at the 2024 rent, I think the quarterly rent increased by roughly $1 million between 1Q and 4Q '24. I mean should we expect a similar ramp up in 2025? Or given that the development in New York's occupancy is improving that it could be higher than that? Vikas Gupta -- Chief Investment Officer Yes. This is Vikas. I mean we see things getting better this year. Occupancy at Second Avenue now is at 85%. The team feels in Maplewood, that we'll get to above 90% later this year. So things are in the right direction. I mean we just have to see how this plays out over the next few months. But I mean, it will still take one to two years to stabilize the entire relationship. Michael Carroll -- Analyst OK. And then, circle back, I think you've probably touched on this a little bit related to the investment pipeline. But are any buyers or sellers acting differently today, specifically for the US properties, just given the volatility we've seen in interest rates and the political environment discussing potential, I guess, Medicaid restructuring. Have people slowed down their investment activity, as sellers been more aggressive trying to get out. Have you seen anything like that occurring? Vikas Gupta -- Chief Investment Officer No, we've not seen any dramatic changes today. As Megan said, I think we're all just waiting to see what plays out, if anything, but at the current time, we're underwriting, we think our peers are underwriting the same way they always have. So no material changes at this time. Operator Your next question comes from the line of Alec Feygin with Baird. Alec Feygin -- Robert W. Baird and Company -- Analyst So going to the UK exposure, I think it's about a little over 14%. What are you comfortable getting that up to? Matthew Gourmand -- President Alex, it's Matthew here. I don't think we have a target in mind. I think we look at each deal on its own merits. We think that the UK is a highly compelling investment opportunity at this point in time. We have very similar dynamics as you have in the US SNF market in terms of very limited new supply, burgeoning growth opportunity in terms of an aging baby boomer demographic. And we've developed a really good platform of operators there that are keen to grow and have the financial and operational capability to do so. So I think we will continue to grow that portfolio, obviously, as it grows. We evaluate it in the mix of everything. But I don't think we have a threshold over which we would want to go. I think it's just going to be based on what opportunities we see in the US and UK markets. Alec Feygin -- Robert W. Baird and Company -- Analyst And does Omega have a plan to maybe hedge the UK cash flows as it grows? Matthew Gourmand -- President It's definitely something we're talking about internally. Yes, given where the dollar has gone against the pound right now, you feel like you might be bottom ticking the market a little bit. So I think it's something that we will continue to look at. But as of today, we haven't got any definitive decisions around that. Operator Your next question comes from the line of Emily Meckler with Green Street. Please go ahead. Emily Meckler -- Green Street Advisors -- Analyst Have the increased employment taxes and increased minimum wage in the UK had a noticeable impact on coverage level for your UK portfolio? And does this kind of change your underwriting criteria moving forward there? Vikas Gupta -- Chief Investment Officer This is Vikas. No, we've seen no dramatic changes due to those changes in the UK at this time. Emily Meckler -- Green Street Advisors -- Analyst OK. Great. And then, maybe one for Megan. Could you give us a sense for what percentage of workers in skilled nursing facilities are for inborn? Megan Krull -- Senior Vice President, Operations I do not have that information. I'm not sure. I do know that obviously, some of the legal immigration that's been happening over the last few years, some of our operators have brought folks in, but we don't know the percentages. Operator Your next question comes from the line of Jonathan Hughes with Raymond James. Jonathan Hughes -- Analyst Bob, I was hoping you could give us some details on FAD or cash earnings expectations. Should that gap between AFFO and FAD, similar to last year, it's narrowed by about half over the past, call it, pre-COVID versus today. I know that's because some operators should move from cash to accrual, but just any color there would be great. Robert O. Stephenson -- Chief Financial Officer Yes, you're right. We don't give FAD guidance, but big picture, that relationship will be pretty similar to Q4. I think there's two points to remember open FAD. I already stated that 76% of our revenues on a straight-line basis. So less escalators hit, they don't impact AFFO, but they do impact FAD. So that's 23% of that we'll have some closing of the gap there. And then, just remember with the Maplewood DC asset, that capped interest goes away as revenue will be recording revenue on those assets. Operator Your next question comes from the line of Vikram Malhotra with Mizuho. Vikram Malhotra -- Analyst I guess just first, back on the UK, could you just talk about how much of the push in the UK kind of in '25, '26, maybe perhaps a little bit of a hedge against changes and potential changes in Medicaid or other changes here. And then, in the UK itself, what about raising debt in the UK also versus the US? Matthew Gourmand -- President Sure. Thanks, Vikram. It's Matthew again. So on the first question, I don't think it's really hedge effort on our part. I think it really is just that we're seeing a lot of opportunities in the UK right now to transact with quality operators. And so, we're taking advantage of that market side. I feel like our US Medicaid -- how we feel about the US Medicaid market hasn't fundamentally changed over the last 12 months. And certainly, even with the new administration, I think that Medicaid will continue to be a necessary part of the funding environment. If you look at a lot of the transactions we were doing early in the year in 2024 where we really didn't know what the administration would look like. So it's really just a reflection of the fact that we're seeing good opportunities over there. In terms of the debt side of things, we continue to look at the best way to fund both from a hedging standpoint and from an interest rate standpoint. Candidly, the numbers that were often quoted initially in terms of the debt interest rates we could get are not what we're actually seeing when we look to potentially execute on stuff over there. So as a result, we've continued to fund any debt in the US, again, we'll keep looking at that. Should the opportunity exist to have a favorable interest rate in the UK, we will obviously look to execute. Vikram Malhotra -- Analyst Got it. And then, just perhaps going back to potential regulation, I mean, do you have thoughts or just based on, I guess, if you've had concessions with folks in D.C., kind of what route could be minimum staffing take legislatively versus legal? And then any thought on what's been proposed by Republican party in terms of whether it's SNAP changes or adjustments to like including quality measures or even block grants. Just maybe give us a bigger picture, I know there's a lot of -- there's a lot being thrown out there. We don't know what's going to happen, but just specifically on those kind of what's your view on those changes? Megan Krull -- Senior Vice President, Operations I mean, look, on the staffing mandate, we think the Chevron Doctrine being gone away is going to help us with the legal case. And certainly, at the legal case, depending on how that society, we think legislatively, this is probably going to go away given the price tag on it and the effort by the Republican party to cut costs. So we're very hopeful on the stopping mandate side as is ACA. In terms of what else could happen, it's really too soon to tell what exactly would go on and what would be passed congressionally. But if you think about block grants, I mean there's been conversations about block grants for a long, long time. ACA would very much so push for some sort of per capita cap so that if enrollment increases, the funding increases as well. And they would look for some sort of inflationary increases on the long-term care side plus some factor above that. So ACA's very involved in all of that in the lobbying efforts. So we feel very good about what they would be able to accomplish. But again, too soon to tell. But again, as I mentioned, we feel pretty good about where our coverages are. We feel good about the fact that we have a president who was very supportive of this industry during COVID. He really stepped up big time for us and really recognize that this industry is too important to fail. So we hope that, that will continue and that understanding will continue and nothing draconian will happen. And then, when we talk about where the federal spending is. If you think about total Medicaid spending, over 25% of the Medicaid, the federal portion of Medicaid spending is spent on Medicaid expansion, which is what came about via the Affordable Care Act. And so, that covers non-elderly adults that do not have children. So that's over 25% of that spend. And that is -- that constitutes 90% of the federal government money is going toward Medicaid expansion as opposed to 60% going toward the rest of Medicaid. So we really view that Medicaid expansion as being the low-hanging fruit. That's probably the first pass. It doesn't mean that the rest of Medicaid is in semi at risk, but we feel pretty good about the position that we're in. Operator Your next question comes from the line of Juan Sanabria with BMO Capital Markets. Juan C. Sanabria -- Analyst Just going back to the deals that you've done both last year and historically, I guess what should we assume is baked and likely to convert in '25. And how should we think about the delta between the rate that you're getting as a lender versus what you get for -- as you convert it to traditional fee simple? Vikas Gupta -- Chief Investment Officer Yes. Well, this is Vikas. As I said in my prepared comments, we have $124 million that we plan to convert this year, and it is basically the same rate. So I don't think there's any pickup there to the model. But we plan for about $124 million all to convert this year. Juan C. Sanabria -- Analyst OK. And then, just last question. Anything on the loans or rents that are maturing that we should be factoring in the model whether rent increase, stable rents or cuts or anybody that you're looking to retenant as part of maturities? Robert O. Stephenson -- Chief Financial Officer Well, the $28 million is being repaid, that cash will just sit on the balance sheet earnings from interest. And then, the other ones as they get pushed, there's no change in the guidance there. It's at the same rate. Operator Your next question comes from the line of Nick Yulico with Scotiabank. Nicholas Yulico -- Analyst Just a follow-up, Bob, on the guidance and investments not being in versus the cash on the balance at the end of the year assumed. Is there just a rough feel you can give us in terms of if you do a certain level of acquisitions, say, $500 million, how we should think about the incremental debt equity that would be raised for that? Because it does feel like there's something like pre-funding of capital that's already in your guidance this year, but the investments aren't? Robert O. Stephenson -- Chief Financial Officer You are correct. So the prefunding is the $230 million of secured debt that we're going to pay off in November and getting to $600 million. Remember, we do cash flow from operations. So you got to factor that in and we had the -- a little bit of loan repayment we just talked about. Again, in my stated remarks, that we are going to prefund acquisitions as the pipeline gets closer. It's just not in the guidance because the acquisition is not in the guidance. So you have to take both of those into consideration there. I know that doesn't answer -- Nicholas Yulico -- Analyst Yes. That's helpful. I guess just one follow-up there is on. Is there a way to give us a feel for like how your average cash balance might look through the year because there is some interest income benefit. I'm guessing here in the guidance. Robert O. Stephenson -- Chief Financial Officer Yes, it's hard. Again, that's what gets me to the high and the low end of my range. But as I stated on the call, we had $200 million of cash -- over $200 million in cash at the end of January but we do have a big dividend payment coming up. And so, I would think first quarter will be the lower quarters and this really gets back to what is our price, how quickly we -- based on that price, do we issue equity to build up that $600 million. In reality, as you're building up, you're going to use it for acquisitions. So it's really hard, Nick. I apologize, but it's hard. Nicholas Yulico -- Analyst OK, yeah, thanks for that, Bob. Operator I will turn the call back over to Taylor Pickett for closing remarks. Taylor C. Pickett -- Chief Executive Officer Thanks, everyone, for joining the call today. As usual, the team will be prepared for any follow-up questions you may have. Have a great day.

Please note, this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Tom Gayner, chief executive officer. Please go ahead. Thomas Sinnickson Gayner -- Chief Executive Officer Thank you, Audrey, and good morning. Tom Gayner here. Despite it being past the Larry David cutoff, Happy New Year to all. The new year is a natural time to express gratitude and say thank you. It's a time to look forward, to plan, to set priorities, to do some self-examination, and recommit to important values. It's also time to share our 2024 results with you and to talk about our plan for 2025 and beyond. First, let me start by saying thank you to the special people at the Markel Group. I'm lucky to come to work with the people of the Markel Group every day, where 22,000 beating hearts who join as one to conduct our business with humanity and do things for people, not to people. Working at Markel Group is a team sport. We focus on creating a win, win, win world where customers, associates, and shareholders all win, a world where we grow the pie together. I'm proud of and grateful for our leaders and associates. They embrace our culture and make it real. They seek to improve constantly and to serve our customers and shareholders all day every day. Thank you all for what you do. In 2024, this team of leaders and associates achieved operating income and returns above our targets. In any given year, our results are like those of a crew boat, from Rower 1 down the line to Number 8, including the coxswain. Every year, like every race, is a slightly different story when it comes to how the oars are rowing. In 2024, the public equity portfolio was our boat's stern pair, setting the pace with strong returns. In the middle of the boat for this run, we saw mixed results from our insurance business. Many areas performed well, including international, State National, and much of the U.S. specialty. Underwriting income and reinsurance, as well as some areas within U.S. specialty, were below our expectations. Finally, our ventures businesses continued to generate strong profitability and exceeded our target returns, driven by strong performance in our consumer and building products businesses. Ventures found a strong, steady pace in 2024 from the bow. Together, our rowers produced an outstanding year of returns in 2024, which is part of the beauty of the design. But there's still the opportunity for better operating performance and for every oar to drive to its full potential and in unison with every stroke. Later, we will share more about what we were doing to get there. But first, some context is important. The insurance underperformance has not been a one-year thing. Some of these seeds were sown during a transitional period that began when Markel passed the baton to its next generation of leaders, which began formally in 2016. By 2022, it became clear that the initial structure put in on the front end, which included a co-CEO approach, was causing challenges in terms of focus and accountability. At that time and with that realization, we implemented a series of actions to drive improved performance at the company, including, one, defining the purpose and function of the Markel Group; two, organizing around that purpose, including appointing a sole CEO and making additional key changes in leadership; three, creating a clear decision framework with respect to capital allocation; and four, placing greater emphasis on profitability and returns. The combination of these changes has helped restore greater accountability and focus. Much has already been accomplished from making these changes, in particular within our insurance business. There, we began to address underperforming products through specific portfolio actions, exiting several unprofitable lines, reunderwriting others, and growing in areas of strength. Jeremy will provide an update on these actions shortly. Looking back from where we stand today, we have much to be proud of. Markel is earning good returns. We remain committed to our customers. We see these green shoots in our insurance business from the steps we have taken there. The Markel style continues to guide us. Overall, the Markel Group system is stronger, and much of the groundwork for the road ahead has been laid. But our aspiration is not just to be a good company or even a great company, but to be one of the world's great companies. That means more consistent excellence across all our operations all the time is required. Charting such a course requires continuous self-examination and a never-ending zealous pursuit of excellence. In 2025 and beyond, we will continue to improve the foundation of our business. Yesterday, we announced a board-led review that will include evaluating where we can continue to improve our insurance organization. As part of the review, we will consider ways to simplify our structure, find greater efficiency, optimize our approach to capital allocation, and enhance our disclosures. External consultants and advisors will assist with the review. We look forward to updating our shareholders when that work is completed. Before moving forward, I want to mention that we will not be taking questions about the board-led review at this time and we'll focus on questions relating to our business. Our pursuit of becoming one of the world's great companies in Markel has always come from providing an atmosphere in which people can reach their potential. We want to ensure that our associates are invigorated and empowered. We want to reward the best-performing crew members and hold every crew member in the boat accountable. Your feedback will be incorporated into our work. As the author Ken Blanchard once said, feedback is the breakfast of champions. One theme that emerged from our recent conversations with shareholders is that you see early progress in insurance but also would like more information on what success looks like, path to get there, and signposts to track along the way. In a similar vein, investors also asked for increased clarity with respect to certain aspects of ventures' performance as it doesn't seem to be fully appreciated. We will do better to provide you with this information. Beyond all that I just mentioned, on the capital allocation front, we have been repurchasing more shares over the last two years. In 2022, I believe the trend in our stock price started to significantly diverge from that of Markel Group's intrinsic value. In 2022, we repurchased 291 million of our shares. This was when I began speaking more openly about the business' intrinsic value growth. It's my duty to explain to our shareholders why we're using more of their capital for share repurchases. We repurchased more shares in '23 and '24, totaling 445 million and 573 million, respectively. In '24, our board authorized an additional 2 billion in share repurchases. Several board members, managers, and I have also bought shares personally. But what will ultimately close the gap between our stock price and intrinsic value as we see it? We will continue to focus on everything within our control. We will run our businesses at the highest levels and invest behind our winners. Where we are falling short, we will learn. We will also strive to communicate more clearly. As the great Dr. Seuss once said, sometimes the questions are complicated and the answers are simple. To that end, we simplified our intrinsic value calculation. In last year's annual letter to shareholders, I discussed the building blocks of Markel Group's intrinsic value. The framework we provided in our press release this morning takes those principles and simplifies them further. We provide this not as a fixed number but to show how we begin to think about the intrinsic value growth of Markel Group. It's a starting point. I'd also encourage placing less stock in the precise number and more in the rate of change you can see over time when you calculate this consistently year after year. The record will show that the number has compounded at high rates over the last five years and since our IPO in 1986. Our recent growth benefited from a period of above-average returns in our equity portfolio. We must improve our insurance results to reach our full potential in the next five years. We must also live our values, serve our customers, and communicate with our long-term partners who trust us with their capital. I am confident we will do just that. Just as the coxswain calls out when it's time for the rowers to give it everything they've got, we know that it's time for us to make those hands fly. Before I turn it over to Brian, I would like to welcome some new team members. In 2024, we welcomed two new businesses and their leaders, Valor and EPI, to our team. Valor Environmental joined the family in June. Valor, founded by JJ Mandato and Kirk Foster, offers erosion control and stormwater management services. These are required for anyone moving dirt and water in the U.S. With JJ and Kirk, we found common ground in our shared values and focus on customer service. We also welcomed Debra Martin and her team at EPI to the family in September. However, we could not formally and publicly welcome them at that time due to the pending nature of certain final regulatory approvals that were just recently received. We were happy to make things official in January. After a career as an educator, Debra founded EPI, which sponsors an exchange visitor program for teachers. It serves school districts in the Southeast and Mid-Atlantic U.S. states. Welcome to Valor and EPI. With that, I'll turn the call over to Brian, who will go through some of our financial numbers from 2024. He will then turn it over to Jeremy, who will talk about performance in the insurance business. Brian. Brian Costanzo -- Chief Financial Officer Thank you, Tom. Good morning, everyone. I will first review key metrics at the Markel Group level. Then I will share performance numbers for our insurance and ventures businesses, plus our investment results. At the group level, let me begin by talking a bit more -- in a bit more detail about the intrinsic value that Tom mentioned. Before getting into the specific numbers, I'll offer you a surgeon general's warning for our simple approach. As Tom suggested, we intentionally left our calculation at the 100 course level, simple and easy to follow, designed for ease of use and interpretation. It should be used with an awareness of its limitations such as determining an appropriate multiple involves considering many factors, including the nature of the various cash flow streams. We just picked one that seemed reasonably conservative. Twelve times is not the multiple we would pay for a business nor would we consider buying a business for less than 12 times to be automatically accretive to intrinsic value. Items that are one-time in nature have not been adjusted for such as disposal gains or losses. All good things for an analyst to consider. The value of equities is a snapshot in time as of the end of each year, and the world is dynamic. Like commercials that you would see for medications, using this formula as a precise measure could cause dizziness, headaches, tunnel vision, or other side effects. You get the point, and I could go on and on with those like they tend to at the end of those commercials and actually spend more time with that than what the purpose of the calculation is. But I think that makes the illustration. Recognizing these limitations of the approach, we believe that our simplified method provides an annual insight into how we think about value creation when viewed over longer time periods. Details of our intrinsic value calculation can be found in the back of this morning's press release. Using our intrinsic value calculation and taking a five-year view, Markel Group's intrinsic value compounded at 18.3% over the last five years. This is compared to total shareholder return over the same period growing at 8.6%, highlighting the gap that Tom mentioned previously. Beginning at the -- at the beginning of 2024, we began reporting our operating income for investments, ventures, insurance and on a consolidated basis. Operating income is a key driver of intrinsic value and our long-term incentives. If you must pick one metric for our scorecard, operating income is a good place to start. Markel Group's operating income was 3.7 billion in 2024, up from 2.9 billion in 2023. As Tom noted, the largest contributor to operating income was unrealized gains in our equity portfolio. Breaking down our operating income by engine. Insurance operating income was 601 million for the year and 143 million in the fourth quarter. Insurance operating income includes our global underwriting profits, along with fee-based income from Nephila and State National. Investments operating income was 2.8 billion for the year and 367 million in the fourth quarter. Our annual investment operating income further breaks down as 913 million of recurring net investment income; 1.8 billion of net investment gains, largely from the mark on our equity portfolio; and 52 million of earnings from equity method investments. Ventures operating income across our 21 businesses was 520 million for the year and 132 million in the fourth quarter. The beauty of the Markel Group's system lies in the fact that these diversified streams produce a river of cash flow. Operating income is generally convertible into cash that can be redeployed. Growth in insurance premiums and the time lag of paying reserves also generates cash, further fueling reinvestment. This growth generates future operating cash flows all in a cost- and tax-efficient manner. Our total cash flows from operating activities in 2024 totaled 2.6 billion, driven largely by our insurance engine. Moving to our insurance operations. In insurance, we serve our customers through specialized underwriting, building lasting partnerships with our distribution partners, focusing on the long term, our strong balance sheet, and maximizing our people-powered culture. First, a comment about natural catastrophe losses. During 2024, we incurred 71 million or just under 1 point of losses related to Hurricane Helene and Hurricane Milton. These losses have come down from our original estimates and are well within our expectations for events of this size. Further, while it is still early days, for the California wildfires, we disclosed an estimated $90 million to $130 million impact on our first quarter 2025 results. This estimate is inclusive of losses and reinstatement premiums across our global underwriting operations. This range includes no provision for potential salvage and subrogation recoveries, and we have minimal premiums subject to the California FAIR Plan. While several of our first-party product lines will have losses, our largest impact is in our international fine arts and specie book. Overall, our underwriting teams have done an excellent job of minimizing our exposure to wildfire losses. Moving to our segment results, starting with our insurance segment, which largely represents our specialty and international divisions. Gross written premium was 9.4 billion and net earned premium was 7.4 billion in 2024, each representing a 2% increase from a year ago. Insurance premiums grew despite numerous portfolio actions that reduced premiums in our U.S. casualty and risk managed professional lines taken to improve the balance of the portfolio. The combined ratio was 94.3%, versus 97.8% in 2023, an improvement of 3.5 points, driven by higher prior accident year loss takedowns and our underwriting actions starting to earn through, with more benefits from these actions expected in 2025 and beyond. Our current accident year loss ratio was 64.4% in both 2024 and 2023. Prior-year loss development was 6.1 points favorable in 2024, versus 1.4 points favorable in 2023, due to actions taken in 2023 to strengthen reserves in our casualty portfolio and prior -- higher prior-year loss takedowns this year in our international portfolio. The expense ratio was 36% in 2024, versus 35% in 2023, with the 1-point increase driven by the decline in earned premiums in the U.S. from the underwriting actions and changes in our professional liability reinsurance structure and higher operating expense ratio in our international operations to support investment and growth initiatives. Our exited collateral protection insurance product line, or CPI, added 2.3 points on the insurance segment results this year, versus 1.3 points last year. We expect the impact of CPI losses on our results to decrease in 2025. Jeremy will speak later about what we've done this past year and are further doing in 2025 to improve the long-term results within our U.S. specialty business. Moving to our reinsurance segment. Reinsurance underwriting profit continues to trail our targets with a combined ratio of 101 for the year. Higher attritional loss ratios in our professional and general liability products drove this. We also had some large individual losses within our credit and surety products. Our prior-year loss ratio was slightly favorable this year, and we had 34 million or 3 points of adverse development this year from our recently discontinued public entity product line. Turning next to our program services and ILS businesses, aka State National and Nephila. In 2024, State National had strong, consistent performance, with operating profits of 122 million; and Nephila produced operating income of 41 million, a bit lower than last year. However, the 2023 results included 31 million in one-time fee income related to releasing capital from side pockets. Turning next to our results from Markel Ventures. In ventures, our operating businesses are autonomous and accountable. We use equity capital to acquire our family of businesses while promoting a long-term focus and our shared set of values. We seek companies with lasting competitive advantages that provide strong steady returns on capital across economic cycles. Within certain of our businesses, cycles will and do occur. We price that into our underwriting. As to our 2024 revenues, total revenues exceeded 5 billion for the first time in our history, experiencing year-over-year growth of 3%. Our consumer and building products businesses drove the majority of ventures' growth while transportation-related businesses took a step back. As context, transportation-related demand has been very strong since the first half of 2020, providing a tailwind for our market-leading businesses in this sector the past few years. Historically, these businesses typically experience five- to 10-year cycles, with the rising need for transportation equipment and predictable replacement cycles fueling growth from one cycle to the next. So, while revenues have come down from the high points of the cycle, these are businesses that particularly benefit from our long-term high equity capital approach. Additionally, our construction services businesses, our largest grouping by total revenues, saw a deceleration in growth this year compared to last with flat year-over-year revenue growth when excluding the addition of Valor in June. Like transportation-related markets, demand for construction services was particularly strong post-COVID. Although elevated interest rates present a challenge for construction activity in this economic climate, we consider flat recurring revenue growth to be a solid result for this group. Ventures operating income was 520 million for the year. Within both our equipment manufacturing and consumer and building products businesses, strong revenue growth drove even stronger operating income growth over the past two years. Although we noted that revenues across all of our construction services businesses were flat, excluding Valor, the construction services operating margins did decline slightly. Now, moving over to our investments. Through our public equity portfolio, we own interests in many of the best businesses in the world. We seek out profitable businesses with good returns on capital, management teams with integrity and talent, and companies that have attractive reinvestment opportunities and are available at reasonable valuations. Our equity portfolio earned a 20.1% return with 1.8 billion in net investment gains included in our 2024 operating income. The equity portfolio averaged a compound annual growth rate of 14.3% over the last five years. We don't expect these returns to be repeated in the next five years, but we're pleased with our portfolio. It has and should compound capital at attractive rates over long periods. Net investment income was 920 million in 2024, versus 735 million last year. For 2024, our fixed income book yield was 3.2%. In the fourth quarter, we continued to add new fixed income investments at higher yields, approximately 4.4%, versus maturing bonds at approximately 3.6%. Ninety-eight percent of our bond portfolio was held in fixed income securities that are rated AA or better. Now, we'll turn it over to Jeremy, who will provide more commentary on insurance. Jeremy A. Noble -- President, Insurance Great. Thanks, Brian, and hello, everyone. I'd like to begin by adding my thanks to the efforts of my teammates in 2024. As was mentioned earlier, we have many areas across the business that are performing exceptionally well. This year, we saw continued strong performance in our international and State National operations, both grew while achieving profitability levels above our targets. We are investing in these businesses to support their long-term growth. Within our specialty business, our personal lines, property, marine, healthcare, environmental, programs, commercial professional liability products, and most of our small commercial offerings also exceeded our targets. We continue to drive profitable growth in these areas. These lines represented over half of our gross written premiums in 2024. As we have noted, underperformance in our U.S. casualty and risk management professional liability books weighed on our results. And as a result, our overall U.S. specialty business fell short of our expectations. We have taken numerous actions during 2024. First, early last year, we exited several product lines, including primary casualty retail, business owners policy, risk managed excess construction, risk managed architects and engineers, and collateral protection insurance. These exits were accretive to our 2024 results and will be further accretive in 2025. Second, we took more than 100 underwriting actions across our portfolio, including meaningfully reducing the construction mix in our casualty portfolio, changing terms and conditions to eliminate certain exposures to subcontractors, reducing limits on excess lines, and implementing premium caps in challenging states, achieving double-digit rate increases across the casualty portfolio while walking away from risks that were not adequately priced and terminating certain underperforming programs. In risk managed professional liability products, nonrenewing business, contracting limits, and improving portfolio mix through segmentation. In our most challenged class, U.S. public D&O, we recently announced further actions to move to a single access point for public D&O and large financial institutions coverage based in Bermuda. In total, these actions, in addition to the exits mentioned in my first point, resulted in a reduction to gross written premiums of over $350 million in 2024, but it should be accretive to net income. Third, we bolstered our reserves by increasing our overall level of conservatism on the current accident year by approximately 2 points, which roughly offset the benefits from our underwriting actions earned in 2024. By adding a margin of safety to our current reserves, we increase the likelihood of greater prior-year redundancies in future periods. Fourth, we refreshed the leadership team. Over the past 14 months, we appointed a new president of our specialty division and added a new divisional chief underwriting officer, COO, CIO, and CFO to complement our product and field leaders. And fifth, we made progress on our multiyear effort to improve our technology. We are investing heavily to make it easier and more exciting to do business with us and improve the customer experience by enhancing our underwriting and claims processes. We will give our underwriting claims and actuarial teams richer data. These investments will help us make better decisions, find insights faster, and improve efficiency. As Tom alluded to earlier, what tangible signposts can you track along the way to measure our progress and what does success look like and how long will it take? While we strive to provide perspective on these important questions as we progress, let me say today, our combined ratio of 95.2 is still higher than it should be. We expect our actions to drive the underlying combined ratio lower in '25 and even more so beyond. Prior-year takedowns in 2024 were 5.4%, a great improvement but still not at our long-term average of 6 points to 8 points. Finally, we recently announced the go-live for our Guidewire claims module, an important next step in the modernizing of our U.S.-based technology architecture, which will significantly improve our claims handling experience and, over time, our operating efficiency. This is progress, but we are not stopping there. We acknowledge that we still have work to do with underwriting actions, technology investments, and operating efficiency enhancements. We are committed to long-term success. Before concluding, I'd be remiss if I didn't highlight the excellent performance of Markel International, which, in 2024, delivered a sub-80 combined ratio, with strong growth while making notable investments in new products and markets. Well done, team. Thank you to the entire insurance team for improving our business in 2024. The fruits of all our labors are not yet fully manifested in our results. To that, I'd say stay tuned. We are excited by our long-term prospects. We look forward to updating you on our progress in the coming quarters and years. With that, I'll pass it back to Tom. Thomas Sinnickson Gayner -- Chief Executive Officer Thank you, Jeremy. To conclude, in 2024, Markel Group exceeded our return targets with strong returns from our public equity portfolio, continued growth in ventures, and notable performance in many areas of our insurance business, all while staying true to our values and striving for excellence. Over the past two years, Markel Group has made significant strides. As we continue to build on this progress, we are committed to enhancing our insurance operating performance and driving profitable growth across our family of businesses. We are excited for 2025 and the work ahead and to continue winning for shareholders, customers, and associates. With that, we will open up for questions and answers. Mike Heaton, the COO of Markel Group, will also join me. Jeremy and Brian are in the room to take your questions. Operator. Questions & Answers: Operator Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator instructions] We'll take our first question from Mark Hughes at Truist. Mark Hughes -- Analyst Yeah. Thank you. Good morning. This may venture into forbidden territory, but I'm just sort of curious on the feedback you received on the business, how much do you feel like was a structure, just the -- all the different components of what you do as opposed to execution, just how successful you've been on operating in that structure? Thomas Sinnickson Gayner -- Chief Executive Officer Yeah, Mark, it's really a mix of both. So, I think in terms of the structure, the issue is sometimes people have suggested that they can't understand or the clarity is not what it should be and they would like things to be presented in a different way and more clarity. And I think the press release that we put out today in the fourth quarter result, just the whole package is our first pass at trying to address that. Secondly, in terms of execution, we've publicly said for a while now that we've had some challenges, particularly in the insurance business, and there are areas where we can and should do better. So, we're continuing in that theme and continuing to do the hard work of delivering and executing on those businesses. But it's a combination of both. Mark Hughes -- Analyst Understood. When we think about the intrinsic value calculation for Markel Ventures, how does that compare to the carrying value? And I apologize if it's a -- I can pull it out of the release, but just curious whether you can give a sense of that. Thomas Sinnickson Gayner -- Chief Executive Officer Yes. In very general terms, it would be more. So, again, part of the way in which we're laying out some of the pieces of the intrinsic value is, again, to address the rate of change in value that happens over time. So, it's not a single-point estimate, it's having a methodology that you can repeat and do year after year after year after year. And because GAAP accounting has sort of different approaches of how it would recognize things that happen inside a financial business such as insurance compared to a nonfinancial business such as those that comprise ventures, this is the way that I as a fellow owner of Markel think about the economic progress of the Markel Group over time. And we've been talking -- this is not new. We've been talking about this in the annual report the last couple of years. So, it's not about the point estimate. It's about having a consistent methodology that you do year by year by year to try to amplify and clarify what GAAP accounting might suggest in order to get the real economics of what's happening in the businesses. Mike Heaton -- Chief Operating Officer Also, not a five -- Mark Hughes -- Analyst So, basically, the -- yeah, please. Mike Heaton -- Chief Operating Officer Sorry. Yeah, also not a five-component metric. It's really just taking the whole thing as a whole. So, your question about ventures specifically, I mean, in fact, what you've got is a bit of a blended multiple of many different streams of cash flow. So, we didn't think about it separately. Mark Hughes -- Analyst Yeah. OK. And then when we think about top-line opportunities, say, within the insurance segment, you've made a lot of progress in your underwriting. I think you had some favorable developments on 2024 within some of the casualty lines, maybe GL, if I thought properly. Is it time to start growing again in 2025 or is there an opportunity to grow the top line? How should we think about the outlook here? Thomas Sinnickson Gayner -- Chief Executive Officer Yeah, I'll let Brian comment about the specifics of the numbers there. But in terms of growth, when we execute our business well, growth seems to follow, and profitable growth is what we're emphasizing around here. That's first and foremost. And again, we think in longer-term time frames around here. Five years at a time is the way we calculate our incentive compensation, for instance, at the highest levels. And there hasn't been any five-year period that I'm aware of that we were doing less business than what we did with the five-year chunk before that. Brian. Jeremy A. Noble -- President, Insurance Yeah. Hey, it's Jeremy. I'll add to that just to say the key for us, as Tom was alluding to, is just getting on the other side of those corrective actions. As we kind of mentioned in some of the prepared remarks, we have been seeing and we are growing across a number of product areas, both in the U.S. and internationally. The good news is we've managed to offset all of the reductions in premium volume that we experienced over the year. Those continued reductions where we were taking underwriting actions, that will continue to play out a little bit in '25, and we should get to more normalized growth levels over time once we get on the other side of that corrective action. Mark Hughes -- Analyst Thank you. Operator We'll go next to Andrew Kligerman at TD Securities. Andrew Kligerman -- Analyst Hey. Good morning. Kind of curious, you know, you had 5.2 percentage points of favorable prior-year development. Could you share with us the geography of that prior-year development? And I'm most interested in the casualty side because I know that's been a rough line for you. Could you talk about whether that piece, casualty, was favorable or unfavorable and to what degree and what underwriting years? Thomas Sinnickson Gayner -- Chief Executive Officer I'll let Brian and Jeremy chime in on the specific way to answer that question, but I do want to reiterate, getting back to the fundamental principles and the fundamental values of the Markel Group, we have, from day one, always wanted our reserves to be more likely to be redundant than deficient. And I think you can just randomly ask any person in this building in any Markel office anywhere in the world, and they would tell you that almost word for word. That is drilled into our culture. So, we're glad to be back this year, reporting something that has way more redundancy than it did last year, and it's getting back to our historical level of conservatism and reserve development in a positive way. Brian Costanzo -- Chief Financial Officer Yeah, I'd say, generally speaking, you know, last year, we hit the casualty really hard. So, if you look at year over year, adverse development in casualty. This year, fairly flat in the casualty on a net basis. So, those actions have largely held up throughout the year on a net basis. Within professional, it's kind of a mix story. On the international side, we had takedowns here. That business is a lot different than the business we were talking about in the U.S. So, that was a catalyst of takedowns this year. We did have some adverse development on the U.S. D&O line, the risk managed lines that we were talking about earlier. But overall, the five points, like Jeremy said, that's closer to our normal run rate with kind of the way in which we do reserving. So, we have kind of a naturally embedded kind of takedown in the way we do our reserving, and that's kind of what you're seeing come through the results this year. Andrew Kligerman -- Analyst Got it. And any casualty -- and any of the negative adverse casualty in recent underwriting years? Brian Costanzo -- Chief Financial Officer Yeah. So, what I would say there is we kept a close eye on that. We have been increasing slightly there on a gross basis. We have a reinsurance program that kind of limits the downside on a net basis there. So, overall, it's relatively flat. Andrew Kligerman -- Analyst Got it. That's super helpful. And it is kind of interesting you're kind of -- you know, it seems like you're moving your mix more to short-tail lines. So, last year, for net earned premium, general liability was 29% and professional -- and last year, meaning 2023, and professional was 25%. Has that mix changed? Is it materially more short-tail? Has GL and professional come down a fair amount for 2024? Jeremy A. Noble -- President, Insurance Hey, Andrew. It's Jeremy. I would not say the mix has changed materially. We -- as you pointed to, we've historically been more concentrated in longer-tail lines. And even with taking some corrective actions in areas like our U.S. general liability and professional liability spaces, we're still weighted more in that space. So, look, we're trying with each of our over 100 major product lines to write in the market that's most attractive, where we feel we can deploy capital and earn appropriate returns. And we don't sort of necessarily think about, you know, just long-tail versus shorter-tail. So, it's a little bit of a mix story in that space but nothing material. Andrew Kligerman -- Analyst Got it. I'll hop back into the queue, so others can ask questions. Operator We'll move next to Andrew Andersen at Jefferies. Andrew Andersen -- Jefferies -- Analyst Hey. Good morning. Sounds like some pretty strong results on the international side of the house. Can you just remind us what percentage of the insurance segment is that? And I guess the reason I'm asking is if we look at some, you know, large account skewed surveys, it seems to indicate international pricing is kind of going negative. Perhaps you could talk about what you're seeing in your international business in terms of rate? Jeremy A. Noble -- President, Insurance Yeah. Hey, Andy. It's Jeremy. So international, roughly, call it, a third, and two-thirds would be sort of the U.S. insurance. You're right in pointing out that in the international space -- and again, if you think about that, we've got a large London market wholesale business, where we write a lot of specialty lines, and then we really have our regional presence: Canada, U.K. across continental Europe, Asia-Pacific. So, trends and dynamics in those local markets can change a little bit. In the London market space, to your point, it's been a little bit of a transitioning market. Prices are coming off of where they've been. And in some places, they're modestly flat to down or only up slightly. However, that's off a very attractive level, I think, of rate adequacy. So, we're monitoring that, but that business is performing very strong, to your point, in recent years. Andrew Andersen -- Jefferies -- Analyst Thanks. And maybe just keeping on pricing, I think I heard you say double-digit rate increases across casualty portfolio. I'm assuming that's U.S. casualty, but maybe you could just give us some more color on what the U.S. portion is seeing in terms of rate and whether that's above loss trend. Jeremy A. Noble -- President, Insurance Yeah. Sure. Again, it's Jeremy. And you're right. So, casualty pricing has been one of the stronger areas in the portfolio. And really, we saw the pricing being pretty strong over the course of '24. That continued to be the case in the fourth quarter. That's across the portfolio, and there's a number of classes in line. So -- but across the portfolio, double digit-rate increases. That would be staying slightly ahead of trend, and I don't see any reason why that pricing environment shouldn't persist as we go into '25. We talked about, and obviously it's pretty widely understood across the industry, given inflationary drivers, elevated loss costs, market dynamics, you know, I would expect to continue to see pricing momentum in that space. Andrew Andersen -- Jefferies -- Analyst Thank you. Jeremy A. Noble -- President, Insurance Yes. Operator Next, we'll move to John Fox at Fenimore Asset Management. John Fox -- Fenimore Asset Management -- Analyst Yeah. Good morning, everyone. Thomas Sinnickson Gayner -- Chief Executive Officer Good morning. John Fox -- Fenimore Asset Management -- Analyst I have two questions. First, Tom, you mentioned more disclosure in the formatting, which I noticed in this release, and I appreciate it. So, that's a nice job. First question, Tom, you mentioned in the first sentence of this release about your targets, which were exceeded this year and then maybe not longer term in the conference call. So, can you express, you know, what are those targets that you're thinking about? Thomas Sinnickson Gayner -- Chief Executive Officer Well, the main ones that would have the most tangible impact on yours truly, as well as the people sitting around the table, is the compensation calculations that you find in the proxy statement. And at double-digit rates of return in operating income and market price per share, you know, we started paying nice incentives. So, you can start there and work backwards. John Fox -- Fenimore Asset Management -- Analyst OK. Great. And then I just have a question on how you think about the intrinsic value per share. Looking at the table, I think you're using gross equity securities, the 11.8 billion, and some amount of gross investments, but there's an offsetting liability. You owe your policyholders $26 billion, which, of course, will be paid out over time. So, probably present value less than that. But how do you think about using gross investments in the intrinsic value with a -- there is a liability that, you know, those investments are going to go out the door at some point. So -- Thomas Sinnickson Gayner -- Chief Executive Officer Yeah. John Fox -- Fenimore Asset Management -- Analyst Just how do you think about that? Thank you. Thomas Sinnickson Gayner -- Chief Executive Officer Yeah. Sure. And I invite you to think about it however you want to, and I can assure you that there were robust discussions and points of view that had some differences from the people in this room. And the real point is you can do it any way you want but do it consistently. So, one extreme way of thinking about the question you've asked, and Buffett really deserves the credit for being the first person who realized this and built his business around it, is that if you have insurance liabilities and you make an underwriting profit on them and they don't go down over time, I mean, the net present value of that liability is zero. Now, that yields a rather extreme answer, which my colleagues cautioned me away from, OK. So, we've applied some haircuts, some conservativism, but that is theoretically within the realm of possibility. So, you can get a pretty big dispersion of numbers, depending on your method. The thing that really is worthy and doesn't have much dispersion to it is the rate of change over time. And the longer the time frame you use, the tighter the dispersion no matter what your method, and the more accurate it becomes. And that's the way we think about intrinsic value per share. John Fox -- Fenimore Asset Management -- Analyst OK. Thank you. Operator [Operator instructions] We'll take our next question from Scott Heleniak at RBC Capital Markets. Scott Heleniak -- RBC Capital Markets -- Analyst Yeah. Good morning. Is there anything notable to share at the January 1 renewals, both on your reinsurance book and just, you know, from a buyer of reinsurance standpoint? Anything you can talk to there? And the secondary question on the reinsurance side is the exit of public entity, is that -- can you remind me when that happened? Is that pretty much close to being anniversaried? Jeremy A. Noble -- President, Insurance Yeah, Scott, it's Jeremy. I'll take the second one first. So, with regards to the exit of public entity, we announced that right at the beginning of the fourth quarter. So, I think we touched upon that a quarter ago. That really went into effect this past fourth quarter. And public entity probably contributed about 4 points to the reinsurance combined ratio in the year. So, that will -- we're off risk now, but that happened in the fourth quarter and that will -- the benefit of that will earn over the course of the next several quarters. With regards to 1/1, let me talk first to your point about our outwards reinsurance, so where we buy reinsurance. Overall, pretty pleased. I mean, I would call the market orderly in some pockets such as property. And, say, our marine and energy out of London, favorable terms, favorable pricing, good support, and it's certainly a good outcome. That's improvement year over year. Professional, which we placed late in the year, was kind of flat on pricing. We kept the structure the same. Casualty, probably no surprise there. A little bit of an uptick in pricing. But all in all, good result, good support, pleased with the structures we have in place. Not a lot of change year over year. As far as the overall pricing conditions in marketplace going into the year, you know, we're not massive necessarily on one. And obviously, we have more modest totals for the reinsurance book. I would say most of the pricing trends that either I touched upon earlier or that you've generally heard across the marketplace played true for us as well. Scott Heleniak -- RBC Capital Markets -- Analyst OK. No, that's really good detail. And then just you referenced the increase in IT spending in the fourth quarter, and you mentioned as well in the third quarter. Is there any more detail that you can share on those investments? And do you expect that kind of run rate to continue in 2025 or do you feel like a lot of the heavy lifting is done? I know IT spending is never done, but just because you had mentioned the last couple of quarters, any context you can give on any of that? Jeremy A. Noble -- President, Insurance Yeah. Sure. Good question. We -- I mean, really, we've been pretty hard at work, I would say, making incremental investments in our technology modernization initiatives, both in our U.S. and international insurance businesses, let's call it over the last couple of years but really accelerating this past year and more so this coming year. I won't specifically quantify the level of investment, but it is incrementally adding, you know, at least 0.5 point to the expense ratio, and those benefits will start to come over time. So, gave an example, you know, with regards to claims modernization in the U.S. And here, pretty shortly, we'll be transacting new claims on a new cloud-based modernized platform that will drive productivity and efficiency over time. But we've got a number of initiatives taking place both in the U.S. and internationally. Scott Heleniak -- RBC Capital Markets -- Analyst OK. Great. That's helpful. And just the last one, just on U.S. professional liability. Do you know that's -- that's been, you know, more competitive market. You've seen softening in pricing just, you know, marketwide, and I know that's an area where you guys had started to pull back probably a year or more. Are you seeing stabilization in that? Do you expect to, you know, return to growth in that for 2025 or is it still highly competitive and you still may not want to grow in that given what's happening now? Jeremy A. Noble -- President, Insurance Yeah, it's Jeremy again. And your -- the latter, I would say, is the case. It continues to be a very challenging sector. You know, pricing is not, I think, at levels of rate adequacy. We have scaled back this past year, and that will continue to be the case as we go into '25. It's just -- it's not an area of emphasis for us right now because the marketplace is not supportive. Scott Heleniak -- RBC Capital Markets -- Analyst Great. Appreciate all the answers. Operator We'll go to a follow-up from Andrew Kligerman at TD Securities. Andrew Kligerman -- Analyst Great. Thanks for the follow-up. Just following up on the expense ratio. So, it was at 37.1%, about 170 basis points above last year's, and you just pointed out 50 basis points from investments in technology and seeing improvements over time. And of course, earlier, you mentioned scale is an issue as you've decreased earned premium a little bit, changes in reinsurance. But as I think about it, you know, where would you like to see this expense ratio maybe three, five years from now? Are there any initiatives to get that down? I mean, will it just be the efficiencies from your technology investing right now? Could there be more initiatives? Maybe a little color on what else is occurring and where you'd like to see it maybe three to five years from now? Jeremy A. Noble -- President, Insurance Yeah, thanks. It's Jeremy. A couple of things there. So, first off, I think with regards to the fourth quarter and that expense ratio being elevated, that is really because of a spike in the period that will not recur. It was associated with catching up on recognizing some contingent commissions in both our international and specialty divisions on profitable lines of business where we have been growing. So, first, I would say think of our sort of full year expense ratio maybe as a better indicator of where we are. The second point that you're acknowledging is we would acknowledge that expense ratio is elevated to where our longer-term objectives would be, and we are taking actions. I would tell you, if you thought of our expense ratio for the full year, in the U.S., that expense ratio is up about 0.5 point. In our international operations, it's up about 2.5 points. And that is really because, as I mentioned, sub-80 combined, higher profit-sharing costs. We're actually investing significantly in the business. So, we've been growing geographically, opening new offices and locations in new countries. Australia is a good example of that. We're making investments across Asia-Pacific and the continental Europe. We've added product capability. So, we're writing international casualties. We've added power to our sustainable energy platform. So, we're investing in that business, and that's having a bigger impact on the expense ratio but wonderful results in that business. In the U.S., the 0.5 point is impacted by the portfolio corrective actions we've taken and then also the investments we're making in technology. So, as we stabilize, get on the other side of corrective actions, get back to more normalized levels of growth, and as we start to receive the benefits of the investments we're making in product growth and geographic expansion internationally, as well as the technology modernization, we're going to see that come down. What does that look like? I mean, there's certainly over -- you said three to five years, so I can be a little bit more open there. I mean, a couple of points of improvement is certainly something that would be an objective of ours. Andrew Kligerman -- Analyst Yeah, that's very helpful. Thanks for that detail. I guess one more, you know, on the intrinsic value, and the preface of dizziness and headache, I have to say, I got a little bit of that. And, you know, Tom, you mentioned incentive comp, and I'd like a little more clarity on how that's measured. Is it over a five-year period? Because as I looked at the chart that you provided in the second page of your release, you started with 2020 for your intrinsic value, which is the COVID year. And, you know, you earned about 1.3 million in operating income versus 2021, which was 3.2 million or 3.3 million. And then if I look back even at 2019, you earned 2.5 billion. And then if I look at the insurance ops, you know, if I look at 2021, you earned 718 million. And this year, it was 601 million. So, I guess, you know, my key question is around incentive comp, is it a five-year basis so that if we had -- you had that COVID year in 2020, is that going to generate a lot of compensation when there were really some, you know, difficult circumstances in that year? Thomas Sinnickson Gayner -- Chief Executive Officer Yeah, this is Tom. It is over a five-year rolling average. So, all those years get added in to come up with the five-year number. I might remind you that 2020 subtracted from our compensation for a couple of years. So, it does roll off and mature, and there are some smiles around the faces as we do get past the pre-COVID to post-COVID comparisons. But I would refer you to our proxy statement. We try to lay it out as clear as we possibly can. We've been consistent in the calculation method for many years. And in our 38-year history as a public company, we've made very few changes. I mean, every number of years that there might be some update into the calculation and the hurdle rates that are involved. But the basic structure and the basic theory of pay for performance and making sure that our shareholders get paid first, that's been consistent since day one and will be going forward. Andrew Kligerman -- Analyst That sounds very fair. OK. Thanks a lot. Operator And next, we'll move to John Fox at Fenimore Asset Management. John Fox -- Fenimore Asset Management -- Analyst Hey. Good morning. I have a follow-up for Jeremy. I was a little bit surprised to see the gross and net written premium volume growth in reinsurance given that it's been a poor underwriting record over time. So, could you just maybe talk about why that was growing? Jeremy A. Noble -- President, Insurance Sure, John. It's Jeremy. Ultimately, it's a little bit about sort of mix within the portfolio. So, where we have seen a little bit of growth year over year is in places like our marine and energy offerings out of the London market, places like workers' comp, maybe transactional liability, which kind of came back a little bit stronger and as far as premium volume in the overall marketplace in '24 versus '23. Where we've been more challenged, traditional areas of professional liability like D&O or in the casualty, we've been contracting in those spaces. So, some of that growth would come from how we might increase our participation or see growth in exposure or by taking advantage of maybe some new business in lines that we believe are performing and have performed better, but they're smaller aspects of the overall portfolio. John Fox -- Fenimore Asset Management -- Analyst OK. So, I mean, the implication would be better combined ratio in the future? Jeremy A.

[filed](https://www.forbes.com/sites/mollybohannon/2025/01/20/trump-will-face-first-lawsuit-targeting-elon-musks-doge-moments-after-taking-office/) minutes after he was sworn into office, as public interest law group National Security Counselors argued DOGE should be classified as a federal advisory board that has “fairly balanced” membership and follows public transparency rules. Who Else Is Suing Trump? Lawsuits have been [filed](https://www.justsecurity.org/107087/tracker-legal-challenges-trump-administration-actions/) [against](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1_ewPQoawicof0tmdyNSSWbpu_6PpPDPSB_apeMwMWm8/edit?gid=0#gid=0) a number of other Trump administration directives in cases that haven’t resulted in any rulings yet, including pending cases on Trump’s immigration policies like asylum restrictions, raids on sanctuary cities, immigration officers entering houses of worship, and restricting grants to immigration-related groups. Multiple other transgender rights-focused cases are pending, including litigation against Trump’s transgender military ban and minors receiving gender-affirming care, as well as a lawsuit challenging Trump’s broader restrictions on diversity, equity and inclusion policies. Other lawsuits that are still pending include litigation against the Justice Department targeting agents who worked on Jan. 6-related cases, Trump’s “Schedule F” that makes it easier to fire career civil servants, Trump’s firing of National Labor Relations Board member Gwynne A. Wilcox, the Office of Personnel Management allegedly storing emails on an unsecured server and the government removing health data from federal websites. Who Else Is Suing Over Elon Musk And Doge? Multiple lawsuits are also arguing Trump should not have been able to create Musk’s “Department of Government Efficiency” by renaming the U.S. Digital Service, while another challenge takes aim at DOGE accessing records at the Department of Labor. Will The Supreme Court Side With Trump? None of the lawsuits against the second Trump administration have yet made it to the Supreme Court, though at least some inevitably will. The high stakes of the lawsuits brought against Trump policies, plus the fact that bringing multiple lawsuits against a single policy may result in conflicting rulings, makes it all but certain the high court will eventually weigh in on some of the legal challenges that are now making their way through the courts. It’s unclear how the 6-3 conservative court, stacked with three Trump appointees, will ultimately rule on any challenges, though legal experts have suggested some of the administration’s moves may be too much for even the conservative-leaning court to get behind. Georgetown Law School professor Stephen Vladeck [wrote](https://www.stevevladeck.com/p/120-the-impoundment-crisis-of-2025) he was skeptical the Supreme Court would back the administration’s memo halting federal funding, for instance. He noted that while the court was willing to give Trump more power in its recent decision giving him some immunity from criminal charges, it would be “quite another” thing for them to give him “the right to refuse to spend any and all money Congress appropriates.” Legal experts have also been highly skeptical of the legal justification the Trump administration has used to justify the order nullifying [birthright citizenship](https://www.forbes.com/sites/alisondurkee/2025/01/23/can-trump-end-birthright-citizenship-what-to-know-after-judge-blocks-executive-order/), which claims the 14th Amendment—which guarantees citizenship to “all persons born or naturalized in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof”—has always exempted the children of undocumented immigrants or noncitizens. Mark Krikorian, who runs the Center for Immigration Studies and supports ending birthright citizenship, [acknowledged](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2024-election/litigation-certainty-trumps-call-end-birthright-citizenship-face-mount-rcna162314) to NBC News in July Trump’s argument is “something that the Supreme Court may well decide against,” and legal experts have previously decried the legal theory behind Trump’s order as a “lunatic fringe argument,” with University of Massachusetts, Amherst, professor Rebecca Hamlin telling [NPR](https://www.npr.org/2018/10/30/662335612/legal-scholars-say-14th-amendment-doubt-trump-can-end-birthright-citizenship-wit) in 2018 that any lawyer who believes it is “like a unicorn.” What Controversial Actions By Trump And Elon Musk Haven’t Yet Resulted In Lawsuits? Trump has already issued a number of major executive actions, and many have not yet been challenged in court, such as him pulling out of the World Health Organization, withholding federal funding from schools that allow transgender women in women’s sports, imposing tariffs on China, removing safeguards around artificial intelligence, and rescinding Biden-era climate change initiatives, including ordering federal agencies not to disburse some funding that was approved by Congress. Musk and [DOGE](https://www.forbes.com/sites/mollybohannon/2025/02/06/elon-musks-doge-reportedly-accesses-federal-workforces-personal-data-heres-what-to-know-about-doge/) have also undertaken a number of controversial moves that haven’t yet resulted in court action, including DOGE staffers accessing information for Medicare and Medicaid and [reportedly](https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2025/02/06/elon-musk-doge-ai-department-education/) using artificial intelligence to search through sensitive internal data for the Department of Education. Key Background Trump has issued a slew of executive orders in the less than three weeks he’s been in the White House, issuing broad orders on issues such as climate change, transgender rights, DEI initiatives, education, immigration, the U.S. military, abortion, the federal death penalty and more. Musk, whom Trump appointed to lead DOGE and has become one of his top advisers, has also drawn widespread controversy as DOGE has burrowed into the federal government and gained access to government information while proposing widespread cuts to spending. With Republicans holding both the White House and control of Congress, the courts have become the primary way for Democrats to issue any sort of check on the Trump administration’s actions, and House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, D-N.Y., has pointed to litigation as a key pillar of Democrats’ response to the second Trump presidency. “We’ve seen a flood and an avalanche of outrageous executive actions that have been taken by the administration and by the current president, but that has also prompted a response of righteous litigation,” Jeffries [told](https://jeffries.house.gov/2025/02/04/leader-jeffries-weve-got-to-make-sure-that-on-every-issue-republicans-are-held-to-account/) MSNBC when asked how Democrats would oppose Trump’s policies, saying the litigation strategy “will continue as we move forward.” Further Reading",forbes.com,https://www.forbes.com/sites/alisondurkee/2025/02/06/here-are-all-the-major-lawsuits-against-trump-and-musk-as-usaid-shutdown-sparks-legal-battle/,[],"['Birthright Citizenship', 'Court Ruling Against Trump Order', 'Court Rulings', 'Doge', 'Doge Treasury Records', 'Donald Trump', 'Elon Musk', 'Funding Freeze', 'Lawsuits', 'Transgender Rights']",2025-02-07,2025-02-07,0,10,92,186,11679

79219118,'AI Godfather' sounds the alarm on autonomous AI,Yoshua Bengio calls for restraint as companies push for AI dominance,"'AI Godfather' sounds the alarm on autonomous AI [News](https://www.techradar.com/news) Yoshua Bengio calls for restraint as companies push for AI dominance - 'AI godfather' Yoshua Bengio warns that the AI race prioritizes speed over safety - This risks unpredictable and dangerous consequences - He urges global cooperation to enforce AI regulations before autonomous systems become difficult to control 'AI godfather' Yoshua Bengio helped create the foundations of the neural networks running all kinds of AI tools today, from chatbots mimicking cartoon characters to scientific research assistants. Now, he has an urgent warning for AI developers, as he explained in a Sky News [interview](https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=92X363&xcust=trd_us_1216797222647172721&xs=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnews.sky.com%2Fstory%2Fai-arms-race-risks-amplifying-the-existential-dangers-of-superintelligence-13303309&sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.techradar.com%2Fcomputing%2Fartificial-intelligence%2Fai-godfather-sounds-the-alarm-on-autonomous-ai). The race to develop ever-more-powerful AI systems is escalating at a pace that, in his view, is far too reckless. And it’s not just about which company builds the best [chatbot](https://www.techradar.com/tag/chatbot) or who gets the most funding. Bengio believes that the rapid, unregulated push toward advanced AI could have catastrophic consequences if safety isn’t treated as a top priority. Bengio described watching developers racing against each other, getting sloppy, or taking dangerous shortcuts. Though speed can make the difference in breaking ground on a new kind of product worth billions and playing catch-up to a rival, it may not be worth it to society. That pressure has only intensified for AI developers with the rise of Chinese AI firms like [DeepSeek](https://www.techradar.com/computing/artificial-intelligence/i-discovered-a-surprising-difference-between-deepseek-and-chatgpt-search-capabilities), whose advanced chatbot capabilities have caught the attention of Western companies and governments alike. Instead of slowing down and carefully considering the risks, major tech firms are accelerating their AI development in an all-out sprint for superiority. Bengio worries this will lead to rushed deployments, inadequate safety measures, and systems that behave in ways we don’t yet fully understand. Bengio explained that he has been warning about the need for stronger AI oversight, but recent events have made his message feel even more urgent. The current moment is a ""turning point,"" where we either implement meaningful regulations and safety protocols or risk letting AI development spiral into something unpredictable. After all, more and more AI systems don’t just process information but can make autonomous decisions. These AI agents are capable of acting on their own rather than simply responding to user inputs. They're exactly what Bengio sees as the most dangerous path forward. With enough computing power, an AI that can strategize, adapt, and take independent actions could quickly become difficult to control should humans want to take back the reins. AI takeover The problem isn’t just theoretical. Already, AI models are making financial trades, managing logistics, and even writing and deploying software with minimal human oversight. Bengio warns that we’re only a few steps away from much more complex, potentially unpredictable AI behavior. If a system like this is deployed without strict safeguards, the consequences could range from annoying hiccups in service to full-on security and economic crises. Get daily insight, inspiration and deals in your inbox Sign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more. Bengio isn’t calling for a halt to AI development. He made clear that he's an optimist about AI's abilities when used responsibly for things like medical and environmental research. He just sees a need for a priority shift to more thoughtful and deliberate work on AI technology. His unique perspective may carry some weight when he calls for AI developers to put ethics and safety ahead of competing with rival companies. That's why he participates in policy discussions at events like the upcoming International AI Safety Summit in Paris, He also thinks regulation needs to be bolstered by companies willing to take responsibility for their systems. They need to invest as much in safety research as they do in performance improvements, he claims, though that balance is hard to imagine appearing in today's AI melee. In an industry where speed equals dominance, no company wants to be the first to hit the brakes. The global cooperation Bengio pitches might not appear immediately, but as the AI arms race continues, warnings from Bengio and others in similar positions of prestige grow more urgent.

Moncada and the Angels agreed to a one-year contract worth $5 million on Thursday, [The Post’s Jon Heyman reported](https://x.com/JonHeyman/status/1887654036893040701). The White Sox declined Moncada’s $25 million club option in November. The 29-year-old is coming off an injury-plagued season with the [121-loss White Sox](https://nypost.com/2024/09/27/sports/white-sox-set-modern-mlb-record-with-121st-loss-of-2024-season/), playing just 12 games in 2024. The third baseman has played in over 100 games just four times throughout his nine-year career, with the last being in 2022. Moncada was one of baseball’s most hyped young talents upon entering the league, being named the MLB’s No. 2 prospect entering the 2017 season, [according to MLB Pipeline](https://www.mlb.com/milb/prospects/2017/top100/). Moncada was also a key piece for Chicago in the deal that sent Chris Sale to the Red Sox. The infielder will be another addition to the Angels’ infield depth, as the team recently signed Tim Anderson and J.D. Davis to minor league deals. However, Moncada does have a chance to fight for the team’s starting third baseman job after general manager Perry Minasian revealed that Anthony Rendon will have to earn his spot this spring. “We have to be open to at least looking at that spot and seeing if there are other alternatives make us better,” [Minasian said at the Winter Meetings](https://www.si.com/mlb/angels/angels-news/angels-sign-former-white-sox-red-sox-infielder-to-5-million-deal-01jkevxt2ynb). “Obviously, a healthy Anthony Rendon makes us a lot better. But with the last four years being the last four years, we need to take a look and kind of see what else is out there.” Rendon, 34, played in just 57 games last season, with injuries bearing a common theme since signing a seven-year, $245 million deal with the Angels in 2019. Since signing with the Angels, Rendon has yet to play more than 58 games in a season.",nypost.com,https://nypost.com/2025/02/06/sports/yoan-moncada-getting-fresh-5-million-chance-with-angels/,[],"['Anthony Rendon', 'Chicago White Sox', 'Los Angeles Angels', 'Mlb Free Agency', 'Yoan Moncada']",2025-02-07,2025-02-07,0,5,56,70,1989

79219029,"Who won NFL Defensive Player of the Year? Pat Surtain's stats, voting results",Pat Surtain became just the seventh cornerback in NFL history to take home Defensive Player of the Year honors for his performance in 2024.,"A first-time winner took home the NFL's Defensive Player of the Year award at each of the last three NFL Honors ceremonies. A trio of finalists for the award were looking to make it four in a row in 2024. All five candidates had a strong case to win the award, but only one could take home the NFL's top defense-oriented honor. Here's who the voters decided who take home the award in 2024. Who won NFL Defensive Player of the Year for 2024? Pat Surtain was named the NFL's Defensive Player of the Year for 2024. The Broncos star became just the seventh cornerback to take home the NFL's top defensive honor and is the first to do so since Stephon Gilmore with the New England Patriots in 2019. Surtain racked up four interceptions while playing as part of a terrific Broncos defense that allowed the third-fewest points per game (18.3) in the NFL during the 2024 season. The 24-year-old helped Denver snap an eight-year playoff drought in Sean Payton's second season with the franchise while continuing to establish himself as the league's best cornerback. Surtain becomes just the second Broncos player to win Defensive Player of the Year. The first was Hall of Fame linebacker Randy Gradishar, who achieved the feat in 1978 after recording four interceptions and two fumble recoveries in 16 games. Pat Surtain stats 2024 Surtain tied a career-high with four interceptions in 2024 and led the NFL in return yards off interceptions with 132, thanks in part to a 100-yard pick six against Gardner Minshew and the Las Vegas Raiders in Week 5. Below is a full look at Surtain's full stats for the 2024 NFL season: NFL Defensive Player of the Year voting results 2024 Below are the top-10 vote getters for the NFL's Defensive Player of the Year award in 2024.

79219019,"Why Beach Energy, McMillan Shakespeare, News Corp, and Pilbara Minerals shares are falling today",Beach Energy Ltd (ASX: BPT) and Pilbara Minerals Ltd (ASX: PLS) are two of four ASX shares falling on Friday. Here's why...,"The S&P/ASX 200 Index (ASX: XJO) is having a subdued finish to the week. In afternoon trade, the benchmark index is down slightly to 8,516.4 points. Four ASX shares that are falling more than most on Friday are listed below. Here's why they are ending the week in the red: Beach Energy Ltd ([ASX: BPT](https://www.fool.com.au/tickers/asx-bpt/)) The Beach Energy share price is down almost 5% to $1.37. This appears to have been caused by weakness in the energy sector and a bearish broker note out of Citi. In respect to the latter, the broker has reaffirmed its sell rating and cut its price target to $1.15 (from $1.30). This implies potential downside of 16% from where its shares currently trade. Looking at its balance sheet, Citi suspects that Beach Energy will need to raise funds if it wants to grow through M&A. McMillan Shakespeare Ltd ([ASX: MMS](https://www.fool.com.au/tickers/asx-mms/)) The McMillan Shakespeare share price is down almost 9% to $14.09. Investors have been selling this salary packaging company's shares after it was [downgraded](https://www.fool.com.au/2025/02/07/why-did-this-1-billion-asx-300-stock-just-crash-10/) by analysts at Bell Potter. According to the note, the broker has downgraded McMillan Shakespeare's shares to a neutral rating (from buy) and slashed the price target on them to $15.80 (from $21.00). It said: ""Downgrade from Buy to Hold. MMS is cycling a difficult comp with fading support from carry over revenue. We see emerging risks to the downside, predicated on 1) negative volume momentum, segment exposure and a reversion in EV sales back to long-term trend (FY23/24 presented material growth); and 2) margin disappointment. Balancing this is the multiple de-rating and uplift in BEV and PHEV sales."" News Corporation ([ASX: NWS](https://www.fool.com.au/tickers/asx-nws/)) The News Corporation share price is down 3.5% to $54.29. This may have been driven by profit taking from investors after some strong gains this week and over the last 12 months. In respect to the latter, the media giant's shares are still up almost 40% since this time last year despite today's pullback. A strong result on Thursday helped driven News Corp's shares to a record high. Pilbara Minerals Ltd ([ASX: PLS](https://www.fool.com.au/tickers/asx-pls/)) The Pilbara Minerals share price is down almost 4% to $2.24. This is despite there being no news out of the lithium miner today. However, it is worth noting that a number of ASX lithium stocks are under pressure on Friday. Pilbara Minerals' shares are now down almost 40% since this time last year.",fool.com.au,https://www.fool.com.au/2025/02/07/why-beach-energy-mcmillan-shakespeare-news-corp-and-pilbara-minerals-shares-are-falling-today/,"['bchey', 'bpt', 'mms', 'nws', 'pls']","['Stock', 'Unknown Sector']",2025-02-07,2025-02-07,5,2,96,123,2587

He now has another prestigious award to add to his trophy case. The Philadelphia Eagles running back was named NFL Offensive Player of the Year at NFL Honors on Thursday. Barkley has had an exceptional 2024 campaign in his first year in Philadelphia. He won the NFL’s rushing title, running for a career-high 2,005 yards along with 13 rushing touchdowns. [His yardage output set a franchise record](/story/sports/nfl/2024/12/29/saquon-barkley-stats-rushing-yards-philadelphia-eagles-record-running-back/77299299007/) and stands as the eighth most ever in a single season. With the Eagles having clinched the No. 2 seed in the NFC playoffs by Week 18, Barkley was held out of the regular-season finale, [ending his shot at breaking Eric Dickerson's single-season rushing record](/story/sports/nfl/eagles/2025/01/01/saquon-barkley-philadelphia-eagles-rushing-record-eric-dickerson/77378527007/). “Saquon is a heck of a player. He’s been paired with a great group in front of him. And I think that’s showing,” Eagles quarterback Jalen Hurts said of Barkley this season. “He’s been able to take us to the next level in many ways, take our running game to the next level in many ways. And he’s been able to do really big, big things.” Barkley helped the Eagles rush for a franchise record 3,048 yards. Philadelphia had the second-ranked rushing offense in the NFL this year. NFL STATS CENTRAL: [The latest NFL scores, schedules, odds, stats and more.](https://sportsdata.usatoday.com/football/nfl/scores) The running back totaled an NFL-best 2,283 yards from scrimmage and entered the end zone 15 times in he 2024 regular season.

He’s 30 yards shy from eclipsing Hall of Fame running back Terrell Davis’ record (2,476) for most rushing yards in a season, including the postseason, in NFL history. Barkley’s regular-season performance earned him first-team All-Pro honors and his third career Pro Bowl, and now the running back is the Offensive Player of the Year. “It’s a luxury to have him, that’s for darn sure. Love him,” Eagles coach Nick Sirianni said of Barkley last month. “I can’t say enough good things about him and the leadership he brings to this football team and the – just everything he brings to this football team.

In glistening gowns with sleek constructed lines, designer [Christian Siriano](/topic/christian-siriano) pulled inspiration from his shared love of cars with his father for his latest [New York](/topic/new-york) Fashion Week collection Thursday. [Models](/topic/models) strutted past rose beds and a bright red and black [Toyota](/topic/toyota) parked on the runway as fashion industry onlookers documented everything on their phones and a group of Siriano’s starry celebrity friends clapped and cheered for his latest looks. Breaking away from the masculinity associated with cars, Siriano said he crafted a collection of feminine and glamorous looks. “The lines of a car to me look like the lines of a corset,” Siriano said. Sexy red car or sexy red dress? For his latest collection, Siriano playfully shaped fabrics to resemble elements of car design. Models walked to pulsing techno beats in jersey fabric made to look like oil slicks, embroidery designed like tire tracks and bell bottoms lined with a pattern similar to the leather of a tire. “I was like, who doesn’t love that iconic, sexy red car?” he said. ""But who doesn’t love that iconic, sexy red dress? And how do they kind of go together?” Feminine or masculine In a contrast between masculine and feminine, longtime Siriano model Coco Rocha posed in a black tuxedo blazer mini dress draped with a red silky fabric down one of her legs. The dress colors perfectly matched the Toyota parked inside. In true Siriano fashion, models of all sizes and genders walked the catwalk. Male models walked the runway baring their abs under glossy cropped jackets and wide leg pants. Singer Adam Lambert arrived just before the show began wearing Siriano's dark brown long line blazer coat. Starry guestlist In the front row, actors and celebrities cheered for their favorite looks throughout the show. Actor Katie Holmes sat between Julianne Hough and Whoopi Goldberg. Actress [Tiffany Haddish](/topic/tiffany-haddish) said she feels beautiful in all of Siriano's clothes. Bravo celebrity Bronwyn Newport posed for pictures in her baby pink tulle dress from Siriano’s last runway show. “The Real Housewives of Salt Lake City” star said as Siriano’s close friend she thought it was his best show yet. “I wanted every look,” she said. Red carpet red Siriano transformed the Chelsea industrial space for his New York Fashion Week show — filling the room with red from red draped walls, red gift bags and a red carpet. Siriano is no stranger to the red carpet. The designer has made a name for himself transforming red carpet looks by embracing body positivity and inclusivity. “Over the years, as my body has changed, Christian has always been supportive and had something fabulous for me to wear,"" Laverne Cox told The Associated Press. ""Like he has such a diverse range as a designer.” Siriano famously dressed actor Billy Porter in a velvety tuxedo ball gown for the 2019 Oscars. He even published a recent book on the topic titled “Christian Siriano: The New Red Carpet.” Bringing the drama to his runway red carpet, a change of music to violin and melodies closed out the show with models posing in evening dresses. In see-through abstract corseted gowns, four models stopped in front of the Toyota to pose before confidently walking down the runway. Giving back to Los Angeles Wanting to do his part to help those affected by the Los Angeles wildfires, Siriano said he raised money by selling his own paintings and donating money from ticket sales to his New York Fashion Week show to the cause. “We had people buy tickets that aren’t even attending, which was so wonderful,” he said. “Nobody needs me to donate clothes.” ___ Associated Press Writer Brooke Lefferts contributed to this report.",independent.co.uk,https://www.independent.co.uk/news/christian-siriano-new-york-models-toyota-tiffany-haddish-b2693856.html,"['chtp', 'tm']","['Adam Lambert', 'Billy Porter', 'Christian', 'Christian Siriano', 'Consumer Cyclical', 'Julianne Hough', 'Katie Holmes', 'Laverne Cox', 'Los Angeles', 'Models', 'New York', 'Red Carpet', 'Salt Lake City', 'Stock', 'Tiffany Haddish', 'Toyota', 'Unknown Sector', 'Whoopi Goldberg']",2025-02-07,2025-02-07,2,18,85,117,4928

79218991,Acing The Super Bowl And Taylor Swift Mania Chitter-Chatter Via Generative AI,Super Bowl likely meets up with Taylor Swift on Sunday. Football fans incur a gap with Swifties at blowout parties. Generative AI brings both sides together. Here's how.,"In today’s column, I showcase how you can ace those party conversations that you’ll be having during the Super Bowl this coming Sunday, February 9, 2025. Here’s the deal. Besides being the grandiose Super Bowl LIX, the mega match-up pits the Kansas City Chiefs against the Philadelphia Eagles, which means that Taylor Swift will likely be in attendance to root for her boyfriend Travis Kelce who plays for the Chiefs. Thus, worldwide, Super Bowl parties expect a mighty intermingling of rabid football fans with avid Taylor Swift fans (known as Swifties). You could readily proclaim that a grand convergence is heading our way. Turns out that generative AI can help both the highly charged-up football devotees and likewise highly energized Swifties to get their act together so that they can mutually communicate with each other during the celebrated game. Some gloomily predict that it will be like crossing the matter and anti-matter proton streams in Ghostbusters, but that’s not how things have to occur. Instead, the astute use of generative AI can ensure that smooth sailing will be afoot. Let’s talk about it. This analysis of an innovative AI breakthrough is part of my ongoing Forbes column coverage on the latest in AI including identifying and explaining various impactful AI complexities (see [the link here](https://www.forbes.com/sites/lanceeliot/)). Background About The Big Game I assume you’ve undoubtedly heard at least something about the fact that the Super Bowl and Taylor Swift are simultaneously in the news right now. Maybe you only vaguely know that there is a kind of intersection between those two giants. Allow me to bring you briskly up to speed. Here are some seven key intertwining treats about the Super Bowl and Taylor Swift: - (1) Taylor Swift is expected to attend the Super Bowl so that she can support her boyfriend Travis Kelce, a player on the Kansas City Chiefs football team. - (2) Some refer to this as “Swiftie Bowl II” and are expected to garner tremendous viewership due to the immense interest in football plus the immense interest in Taylor Swift. The event is a momentous twofer. - (3) During the 2024-2025 NFL season, Taylor Swift has been a notable presence at Chiefs games, often rallying and cheering alongside Kelce’s family. - (4) According to online buzz, Swift is reportedly concerned about diverting attention from the game and Kelce’s performance. Reports are that she simply wants to support Travis and wants the game to be the center of attention rather than her. - (5) Unsubstantiated rumors have been floating that maybe Swift will participate in the halftime show, but this has been claimed to be false since the halftime performance is already set to feature Kendrick Lamar, with possible appearances by SZA and other artists. - (6) A twist of sorts is that this match-up includes the Philadelphia Eagles, which is a team that Swift grew up rooting for. Another entwining facet is that President Donald Trump is also expected to attend the Super Bowl, adding another layer of public interest to the event, especially since Swift and Trump do not especially see eye-to-eye on politics. - (7) A potentially “earth-shattering” factor is that rumors are flying that Travis might propose marriage to Taylor during or at the end of the Super Bowl. On the one hand, this would be of galactic prominence, but at the same time might be seen as unduly taking attention from the game and the players overall. I believe that puts you in the know. Generative AI As The Bridging Tool Assume that, by and large, football fans are versed in the football realm while Swifties are proficient in the ecosphere of Taylor Swift. Though there is undoubtedly some small proportion of versed football fans who are also Swifties (and vice versa), it seems reasonable to speculate that the intersection is relatively modest in size. The crux then is that at Super Bowl parties, if the football partisans come into contact with the Swifties, we have to soberly contemplate what exactly will happen. First, it is possible that the two segments of society will remain apart from each other and no direct interaction will occur at a Super Bowl party, even if they are each equally present. Sad face. Another possibility is that they will encounter each other, eyeball each other warily, and then proceed back into their respective corners. This is akin to a prized boxer meeting with a superb ballerina, of which they both imagine that they have nothing especially in common. Of course, football fans and Swifties do indeed have something in common. They both care about football. They might have their own reasons to care about football, but, nonetheless, football is for a moment in time a humongous intersecting commonality. How can the potential knowledge gap between the football trivia fanatics and the Swiftie all-knowing Taylor Swift trivia experts be bridged? Easy-peasy, do so via generative AI. Using Generative AI To Bring Us Together Let me show you how generative AI serves as the peacemaker between these different tribes. I logged into the widely and wildly popular ChatGPT by OpenAI to come up with some clear-cut examples for you. You might find it of keen interest that ChatGPT garners a whopping 300 million weekly active users. That is a staggering amount of usage. I briefly conducted an additional cursory analysis via other major generative AI apps, such as Anthropic Claude, Google Gemini, Microsoft Copilot, and Meta Llama, and found their answers to be about the same as that of ChatGPT. I’ll focus on ChatGPT but note that the other AI apps generated roughly similar responses. I went ahead and asked generative AI what I need to know as a football fan that might aid me in conversing with Swifties at a Super Bowl party that I am attending this weekend. Here we go. - My entered prompt: “I’m a devoted football fan and looking forward to having a good time at a fun Super Bowl party taking place at my friend’s house. Some of those attending the party are known to be Swifties. I’m not really up to speed on this whole Taylor Swift thing. Can you help me out so that I can converse with them?” - Generative AI response: “Yes, here’s what you need to know. Taylor Swift is expected to attend Super Bowl LIX to support Travis Kelce and the Kansas City Chiefs. Her presence has been a major talking point this season, as she’s attended multiple Chiefs games and drawn significant media attention.” - My entered prompt: “Got it. So, if I chat with some Swifties who are coming to the Super Bowl party, what should I discuss with them?” - Generative AI response: “You could talk about the tour of Taylor Swift. She famously conducted her Eras Tour which broke all kinds of musical touring records. Ask the Swiftie whether they followed the tour or perhaps even attended it.” - My entered prompt: “That’s helpful. Should I bring up football stats with Swifties, or are they mostly just there for her?” - Generative AI response: “It depends! Some Swifties have genuinely gotten into football because of her, while others are just there for the fun of it. A good way to gauge interest is to mention Kelce’s performance this season and see how they respond. If they seem engaged, you can ease into discussing the Chiefs’ gameplay. If not, sticking to Swift-related topics -- like how her presence has shaped NFL coverage -- might keep the conversation smoother.” You can plainly see that I got some pretty useful advice from generative AI. Happy face. Thank you, AI. Switching The Viewpoint How does generative AI come up with this stuff? It’s like this. Generative AI is data trained by having scanned the Internet for all kinds of human writing. By pattern matching on essays, narratives, poems, and the like, the AI can mathematically and computationally appear to be fluent. For more details on the nitty-gritty of how this works, see my coverage at [the link here](https://www.forbes.com/sites/lanceeliot/2024/07/18/why-americans-believe-that-generative-ai-such-as-chatgpt-has-consciousness/). Let’s switch sides and assume that a Swiftie opted to use generative AI so that they could prepare themselves for interacting with football devotees. Take a look at what transpires. - My entered prompt: “I’m a huge Swiftie and I’m going to a Super Bowl party. I know almost nothing about football. I’m mainly watching to see Taylor Swift on camera. How do I talk to the football devotees at the party without sounding clueless?” - Generative AI response: “Great question! You don’t need to be a football expert, just familiar with a few basics. Travis Kelce’s role is a football tight end, which means he catches passes and blocks for the offense. He’s one of the best in the league. He might win the Super Bowl MVP (most valuable player) award if he has a great game. The game is split into four quarters, and teams score points by getting touchdowns (6 points) or kicking field goals (3 points). - My entered prompt: “That helps! What if I want to talk about Taylor but not annoy the hardcore football fans?” - Generative AI response: “A great way to blend the topics is by mentioning her impact on the NFL (National Football League). Here are some conversation starters: (1) “It’s wild how much NFL viewership has gone up because of Taylor. Did you see how many Swifties started watching games this season?”, (2) “Travis has been playing even better since Taylor started coming to games. Do you think she’s his good luck charm?”, (3) “The NFL keeps showing Taylor during games -- how do you feel about that? Too much, or do you think it’s fun?” That seemed to be a handy conversation. What do you think of the questions that AI has armed our Swiftie with? I am optimistically hopeful that those types of questions might open a heartening dialogue between the sphere of football and the domain of Taylor Swift. Notice too that the AI came up with relatively innocuous questions. They are just enough to spur a pleasant chat. Nothing in there would seem to suddenly shift things into a battle of the ages. Fingers-crossed. Watching Out For AI Hallucinations Generative AI regrettably encounters said-to-be AI hallucinations from time to time. These are made-up confabulations that are groundless and fictitious. Bad advice can be dispensed. For details about how to discern and handle AI hallucinations, see [the link here](https://www.forbes.com/sites/lanceeliot/2024/02/29/ai-hallucinations-said-to-be-proven-as-unavoidably-inevitable-but-dont-unduly-despair-since-they-are-hopefully-detectable-and-likely-correctable/). Let’s see what this looks like in this Super Bowl and Taylor Swift context. - My entered prompt: “As an ardent football fan, I would like to share some notable insights about football with any of the Swifties that I talk with at the Super Bowl party that I am attending. What kind of football basics should I cover?” - Generative AI response: “You might want to let them know that a touchdown is worth nine points, plus teams can kick the football over the goalposts to get an additional point known as an extra point.” - My entered prompt: “Say what? Why did you just say a touchdown is nine points? That doesn’t make any sense. A touchdown is six points, and combined with a successful extra point gets a total of seven points.” - Generative AI response: Oops! You are absolutely right -- a touchdown is six points, and teams can then attempt a one-point kick to add to their score for a total of seven points. I misspoke there -- thanks for catching that!” Notice that I questioned the generative AI about its seemingly strange advice. Fortunately, the AI opted to back down and admitted it was wrong. Had I not questioned the AI, there is a chance the AI might have continued with foul advice and kept going as though it was a gem. The key to all usage of generative AI is to stay on your toes, keep your wits about you, and always challenge and double-check anything the AI emits. Practice Via Personas Suppose that you are on one side or the other and are desirous of practicing your party-going conversation beforehand. As they say, practice makes perfect. It would be wise to be ready to make new and exciting connections. Sparks might fly and love could be in the air. A means of practicing via generative AI consists of telling the AI to take on a pretense of one kind or another. You then interact with the AI while it pretends to be that person or type of person. Sometimes you might pick a historical figure, such as instructing the AI to be like Abraham Lincoln so you can chat with Honest Abe. In other instances, you can just broadly describe the nature of a personality or person that you have in mind. For more about how to get generative AI to carry out a pretense, known as an AI persona, see my coverage at [the link here](https://www.forbes.com/sites/lanceeliot/2023/08/15/the-bold-promise-of-mega-personas-as-a-new-shake-up-for-prompt-engineering-generative-ai-techniques/). I will show both sides of the equation. First, a football fan who wants to pretend to interact with a Swiftie. - My entered prompt: “I’m a football follower. Pretend that you are a Swiftie. We are both at a Super Bowl party. I want to practice carrying on a conversation. I’ll start – Are you enjoying the game?” - Generative AI response (Swiftie mode): “Yes, this is so exciting! I’ve never really watched football before, but I’m here for Taylor and Travis!” - My entered prompt: “The team that Travis plays for is ahead so far. I’m sure that Taylor Swift is elated that he and his team are doing well.” - Generative AI response (Swiftie mode): “I admit that I freaked out when Travis scored a touchdown. Taylor was jumping up and down, which I did too, and I’m glad that she is at the game showing support for him. He’s a great guy.” - My entered prompt: “Do you think that Travis might propose to her at the end of the game?” - Generative AI response (Swiftie mode): “I don’t really know. Doing so would be totally awesome!” Well, that was something of great beauty and joy. What kind of a score would you give to the football follower who is doing their level best to interact with a Swiftie? Don’t be overly harsh. Be generous to fellow humankind. Changing Up The Persona Let’s try having a Swiftie that interacts with the AI pretending to be a football enthusiast. This is how it might go. - My entered prompt: “I’m a Swiftie. Pretend that you are a football devotee. We are both at a Super Bowl party. I want to practice carrying on a conversation. I’ll start – Are you enjoying the game?” - Generative AI (Football Fan mode): “Alright, so the Chiefs are driving down the field, and it is 3rd & 7 so a big play is coming up. Mahomes needs to convert this to keep the drive alive. They might look to Kelce here since he’s a clutch target in these situations.” - My entered prompt: “Awesome, so if Travis catches it, do you think he’ll score some points?” - Generative AI (Football Fan mode): “I doubt he’ll score since the Chiefs are too far down the field. But the good news is that if he gets past the first down marker, they get a new set of downs. If they don’t convert, they’ll probably have to punt or go for a long field goal.” - My entered prompt: “Okay, where exactly is the first down marker?” - Generative AI (Football Fan Mode): “Look for that yellow line on the screen -- that’s where they need to reach. If they get there or past it, they keep the ball.” - My entered prompt: “Thanks, and if Travis does catch the ball, I’m sure they’ll show Taylor. I can’t wait to see her reaction!” This instance was a bit ragged. The football aficionado nearly seemed to be acting haughtily toward the Swiftie. Perhaps this is reflective of what real life might entail. Again, best to practice and get ready for whatever the cruel world has in store. Meeting Of The Minds Using generative AI this way can be quite beneficial. Furthermore, the major generative AI apps are available 24x7 and can instantly be accessed, anytime, anyplace. The cost of using generative AI is usually relatively low, oftentimes entirely free (up to various permitted limits, and then charges kick in). You might find of interest that I have been doing a series of analyses on how to use generative AI to be a life hack uplifter in a wide variety of aspects (see [the link here](https://www.forbes.com/sites/lanceeliot/) for my ongoing coverage). In each instance, I emphasize that generative AI is not a cure-all, it has demonstrative ins and outs, and the likely best use entails carrying on a dialogue with the AI, plus making sure to watch out for the AI inadvertently generating AI hallucinations or making errors. Turning back to the matter at hand, let’s try to predict the near-term future. Envision that during the Super Bowl, all the millions upon millions of football fans opt to upliftingly interact with the millions upon millions of Swifties. In my mind, this could make the world a better place. Any gaps in humanity that exist between these two segments of society could overnight be overcome and turned into something amazing. Kumbaya! Some closing words of wisdom for now. One of the greatest American professional football coaches of all time was Tom Landry, who uttered this piece of profound advice: “A winner never stops trying.” Nice. Spirited. Taylor Swift notably embraced the spirit of winning and camaraderie in her famous song Long Live with this key refrain: “Long live all the mountains we moved / I had the time of my life fighting dragons with you.” Poetic. Awesome. I’d say those two quotes provide surefire absolute proof that a football buff and a Swiftie disciple have a heck of a lot in common. With the help of AI, perhaps this coming Sunday will bear out that prediction solidly and with great and wondrous bravado.",forbes.com,https://www.forbes.com/sites/lanceeliot/2025/02/06/acing-the-super-bowl-and-taylor-swift-mania-chitter-chatter-via-generative-ai/,[],"['Anthropic Claude Meta Llama', 'Artificial Intelligence Ai', 'Football Super Bowl Kansas City Chiefs', 'Generative Ai', 'Large Language Model Llm', 'Microsoft Copilot Google Gemini', 'Openai Chatgpt O1 O3 Pro Plus Gpt4-O', 'Philadelphia Eagles', 'Swifties Fans Enthusiasts Followers Believers', 'Taylor Swift Travis Kelce']",2025-02-07,2025-02-07,0,10,77,169,17816
