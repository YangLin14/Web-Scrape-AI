79086503,Is this the worst Congressional crypto trade yet?,This prolific crypto trader from Congress might have executed one of the worst-timed digital assets trades this January.,"Though [J.D. Vance](https://finbold.com/guide/jd-vances-net-worth-revealed/) and [Ted Cruz](https://finbold.com/guide/ted-cruz-net-worth/) have been much discussed for their [cryptocurrency](https://finbold.com/cryptocurrencies/) – and primarily [Bitcoin](https://finbold.com/guide/fastest-way-to-buy-bitcoin/) ([BTC](https://finbold.com/cryptocurrency/bitcoin/)) – holdings, they have been far from the most prolific digital assets traders among U.S. politicians. Representative Mike Collins of Georgia’s 10th congressional district has been an active cryptocurrency trader with [an affinity for altcoins and meme coins](https://finbold.com/u-s-politician-just-made-a-super-suspicious-crypto-trade/). Since late 2023, he has reported dozens of trades involving coins and tokens such as [Ethereum](https://finbold.com/guide/fastest-way-to-buy-ethereum/) ([ETH](https://finbold.com/cryptocurrency/ethereum/)), Velodrome ([VELO](https://finbold.com/cryptocurrency/velodrome-finance/)), and Aerodrome ([AERO](https://finbold.com/cryptocurrency/aerodrome-finance/)). As the latest filings retrieved with [Finbold’s Congressional trading tracker](https://finbold.com/trading-signals/congress-trades/) – and as Finbold’s earlier [coverage](https://finbold.com/u-s-politician-takes-suspicious-crypto-trading-to-the-next-level/) – revealed, Collins has been active in the cryptocurrency market in 2025 as well, and his latest three trades – all reported on February 3 – involved ETH and Virtuals Protocol ([VIRTUAL](https://finbold.com/cryptocurrency/virtual-protocol/)).

The signal triggers based on updates from the House disclosure reports, notifying you of their latest stock transactions. Specifically, the Representative purchased up to $15,000 worth of ETH and up to $15,000 of VIRTUAL on January 3. Though he, by press time, retains the Ethereum, he sold Virtuals Protocol already on January 12. Did Representative Collins sell VIRTUAL on the worst possible day? The VIRTUAL trade might be one of his worst to date as the cryptocurrency was trading at approximately $4.30 on January 3 and collapsed to about $2.70 by January 12 – though it is worth pointing out there were substantial price fluctuations within both days. Had Representative Collins held the position – worth up to $15,000 – for several days longer, he could have offloaded VIRTUAL near his buying price. The cryptocurrency reached a temporary high above $3.80 on January 15. On the other hand, had the gentleman from Georgia decided to hodl, he would have faced losses up to $9,500 instead of the actual maximum of approximately $5,600 as Virtuals Protocol is, at press time on February 4, changing hands at $1.59.

The situation with the January 3 Ethereum isn’t much better other than because the loss is unrealized at press time. Specifically, ETH was trading at approximately $3,500 – though, again, with significant fluctuations within the day – and it is, at press time, trading at $2,778.79 following an 18.46% year-to-date (YTD) drop. This means that in addition to losing up to $5,600 on VIRTUAL, Representative Collins could be down to as little as $11,909.10 on ETH out of the original investment that could have been as big as $15,000.

Senators and congresspeople tend to secure far greater returns in the stock market than their constituents do. Of all the politicians on Capitol Hill, [Nancy Pelosi](https://finbold.com/guide/nancy-pelosi-net-worth/) is assuredly the most notorious trader. The former Speaker of the House and current representative of California’s 11th congressional district has made millions in the financial markets over the course of her long tenure. Many have turned to [emulating her investments](https://finbold.com/guide/how-to-monitor-congress-stock-trades/) in a bid to replicate her successes. Despite a [few notable missteps](https://finbold.com/end-of-an-era-is-nancy-pelosi-losing-her-stock-market-touch/), on the whole, Pelosi is still firmly in the green — over the course of 2024, her stock portfolio [secured a 146.2% return](https://finbold.com/if-you-put-1000-into-a-nancy-pelosi-portfolio-at-the-start-of-2024-heres-your-return-now/).

A January 17 [periodic transaction report](https://disclosures-clerk.house.gov/public_disc/ptr-pdfs/2025/20026590.pdf) from the Clerk of the House of Representatives retrieved by Finbold’s [congressional trading radar](https://finbold.com/trading-signals/congress-trades/) revealed that the congresswoman has given her portfolio quite a significant update. Nancy Pelosi purchased millions of dollars worth of stock options From December 20 to January 14, Nancy Pelosi made a total of 9 transactions. A majority — 7, to be precise, were purchases — although even her 2 sales were valued in the millions. On December 31, Pelosi sold 31,600 [Apple](https://finbold.com/guide/how-to-short-apple-stock/) (NASDAQ: [AAPL](https://finbold.com/stock/apple-aapl)) shares. At the time, Apple stock was trading at $250.42 — meaning that the sale was worth $7,913,272. On the same day, the representative also sold 10,000 [Nvidia](https://finbold.com/guide/how-to-buy-nvidia-stock/) (NASDAQ: [NVDA](https://finbold.com/stock/nvidia-stock-nvda)) shares for $134.29 apiece — netting her an additional $1,342,900. Put together, Pelosi made $9,256,172 — roughly 53 times her $174,000 annual salary as a representative. Her timing was impeccable, as it usually is — since the sale, AAPL stock has gone down 5.69%. Even more interestingly, Pelosi’s purchases did not entail directly buying stocks — instead, the former speaker opted instead to purchase [call options](https://finbold.com/guide/the-stock-market-trick-that-could-make-you-a-millionaire-overnight/). Most of her purchases gravitated toward the tech industry. The congresswoman purchased 50 call options with varying strike prices, depending on the underlying stock in question — but the expiration date on all of her options is the same — January 16, 2026.

78479198,U.S. politician’s historic XRP bet pays off with 40% gain,"Guy Reschenthaler’s XRP investment returned 40% in a little over a month — however, the congressman might have had an edge.","Sitting members of the U.S. House of Representatives and Senate have an informational edge over the public. Worse still, they regulate the very industries they so often invest in — and they tend to [secure impressive returns](https://finbold.com/guide/how-to-align-your-investments-with-congress-stock-trades/) for themselves in the process. The cryptocurrency space, however, is much less regulated on the whole — and politicians on Capitol Hill have a much smaller advantage when it comes to this asset class. But, with the outsized returns that [cryptocurrencies](https://finbold.com/cryptocurrencies/) have provided, it was only a matter of time before lawmakers began to dip their toes in the water, so to speak. In many ways, 2024 was a year of firsts — we saw the first congressional meme coin purchase from Georgia representative Michael Collins, who purchased Ski Mask Dog (SKI) [in early December](https://finbold.com/u-s-politician-takes-suspicious-crypto-trading-to-the-next-level/), as well as the first congressional purchase of [XRP](https://finbold.com/cryptocurrency/ripple) — which was executed by Pennsylvanian representative Guy Reschenthaler [on December 11](https://finbold.com/u-s-congress-member-discloses-cryptocurrency-trade/).

The second purchase is much more significant, however — as interesting as Collins’ bet on SKI was, it appears to be a random stroke of luck. In contrast, Reschenthaler’s investment has seen a 40% return — and in a rare case when it comes to crypto, the congressman might have had an information advantage. Congressman’s XRP purchase nets a 40% gain in a little over a month Per a [periodic transaction report](https://disclosures-clerk.house.gov/public_disc/ptr-pdfs/2025/20026547.pdf) made public on January 9, the Pennsylvania congressman invested between $1,001 and $15,000 in XRP on December 11, a time when the digital asset was trading at a price of $2.35. Since then, the price of [XRP](https://finbold.com/guide/how-to-buy-ripple-xrp/) has surged to $3.29 — by press time on January 16, the token had marked a 10.29% gain on the daily chart. The rally was driven primarily by better-than-expected inflation numbers — as well as a Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) [appeal brief](https://x.com/attorneyjeremy1/status/1879719207988048327) against Ripple Labs that was [widely judged to be lackluster](https://finbold.com/ripple-v-sec-case-update-january-16-2025/). All in all, XRP has seen prices increase by exactly 40% since Reschenthaler’s purchase. At present, his holdings could be worth anywhere from $1,401 to $21,000 — in other words, the representative earned between $400 and $6,000 on XRP alone. Reschenthaler isn’t your run-of-the-mill congressman — as the Republican party’s chief Deputy Whip in Congress, he is instrumental in maintaining party discipline. Being somewhat of an insider within the party, he is well-positioned to get wind of Trump’s intentions early — and currently, most analysts expect the President-elect’s SEC picks to [dismiss the case against Ripple](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/trumps-sec-review-potentially-freeze-075908045.html) soon after the inauguration.

In many ways, 2024 was a watershed moment — bringing widespread attention to the controversial practice. Lawmakers have an informational edge over the general public — and regulate the very industries they often invest in. While a spotlight has been shined on congressional stock trading, efforts to curtail the practice have [provided little in terms of results](https://www.politico.com/news/magazine/2020/03/25/congress-stock-trade-148678) so far. With that in mind, many traders have adopted an alternate approach — opting instead to copy the trades of their representatives in a bid to emulate some of their successes.

On the other hand, taking a page out of the playbook of some of the more successful congressional traders would have provided an advantage. With 2024 already behind us, Finbold has decided to examine which U.S. politicians have made the greatest return in the financial markets over the course of last year. Several politicians have made triple-digit returns in 2024. [Nancy Pelosi](https://finbold.com/guide/nancy-pelosi-net-worth/) is perhaps the most renowned (or notorious) congressional stock trader. As a representative, Pelosi earns $174,000 per year — throughout the course of 2024, her net worth increased from $231 million [to $273 million](https://finbold.com/these-u-s-politicians-made-the-most-from-stocks-in-2024/?utm_source=chatgpt.com) — with the $42 million increase equivalent to roughly 241 times her annual salary. The former speaker’s investments netted a 146.2% return in 2024 — but as impressive as those gains are, Pelosi is not the trader who made the biggest profit in 2024. Surprisingly enough, the lawmaker who made the greatest returns is not an active trader. Representative Brian Higgins of New York’s 26th congressional district, whose tenure ended in 2024, has made just three trades during his time on Capitol Hill. Those trades happened to include [Nvidia](https://finbold.com/guide/how-to-buy-nvidia-stock/) (NASDAQ: [NVDA](https://finbold.com/stock/nvidia-stock-nvda)) — and with a simple buy-and-hold approach, Higgins captured the entirety of the 185.97% rally experienced by Nvidia stock in 2024. The same approach made Higgins the [most successful congressional trader of 2023](https://finbold.com/these-congress-members-made-the-highest-stock-returns-in-2023/). Finally, readers should note that estimating the returns netted by congresspeople is a tall order — as the exact amounts being invested are obscured by disclosure rules which see reporting done in ranges, the closest estimate that can be given is applying a simple appraisal on a year-to-date (YTD) basis.

78104258,U.S. politician takes suspicious crypto trading to the next level,"The Representative behind the most suspicious Congressional cryptocurrency trade just disclosed another, even stranger investment.","Though Congressional [stock](https://finbold.com/stocks/) trading has been pervasive for decades to the point that the STOCKS Act was implemented to prevent politicians from investing based on information [they receive](https://finbold.com/guide/insider-trading/) thanks to their official roles, 2024 brought a new development to the trend: [cryptocurrency trading](https://finbold.com/cryptocurrencies/). By press time on January 3, 2025, the most interesting and suspicious example came in the form of a series of [meme coin](https://finbold.com/guide/types-of-cryptocurrency/) purchases executed by Representative Mike Collins, Georgia’s 10th congressional district. Since December 1, 2024, Collins has [bought up to $45,000](https://finbold.com/u-s-politician-just-made-a-super-suspicious-crypto-trade/) of a token called Ski Mask Dog (SKI), arguably helping the minor digital asset skyrocket in value. Picks for you Receive Signals on US Congress Members' Stock Trades Stay up-to-date on the trading activity of US Congress members. The signal triggers based on updates from the House disclosure reports, notifying you of their latest stock transactions. Mike Collins’ highly suspicious meme coin trades Specifically, the first SKI purchase was executed on December 1 at an approximate price of $0.092, the second – on December 2 – at about $0.11, and the most recent known buy – dated December 3 – was also near $0.11. At press time, just one month later, Ski Mask Dog was changing hands at $0.2491, meaning the Representative made up to $58,000 as his original investment – worth up to $45,000 – could have appreciated to about $108,000. The final SKI batch is particularly suspicious as, unlike the first two trades that were filed by December 2, it remained undisclosed until New Year’s Day, raising the question of why there was such a long waiting period and of how many additional trades the politician made. Furthermore, the entire trade demonstrates the possibility that Congressional trading has become a tool of price manipulation – either intentional or accidental. The fact that SKI rallied from about $0.09 before the initial purchase was disclosed to a short-lived peak above $0.35 just days later, and by the fact the meme coin is up more than 20% in the last 24 hours – shortly after the January 1 filing was made – lends additional credence to the notion. Is Congressional trading destabilizing the markets? The reputation many Congresspeople have as savvy traders created a phenomenon in which many regular investors seek to [mimic their strategies](https://finbold.com/trading-signals/senator-trades/), generating substantial buying pressure as soon as the filings are made public. A similar trend is seen with some other public figures, such as [Elon Musk](https://finbold.com/guide/how-much-money-does-elon-musk-make-a-second/) as his statements, [X](https://finbold.com/guide/how-to-buy-x-stock/) posts, and other actions are known to cause significant market shifts. A meme coin called KEKIUS MAXIMUS (KEKIUS) exploded in value around the New Year after the South African-Canadian-American billionaire changed his name and profile picture on social media to Kekius Maximus, enabling at least one trader to turn a [$66 investment into more than $3 million in profit](https://finbold.com/crypto-trader-turns-66-into-3-million-in-just-18-days/).

Senators and representatives have access to a level of information that the general public is not privy to. Worse still, lawmakers regulate the very industries they are investing in — quite often, they even sit on congressional or senatorial committees focusing on specific sectors. Little headway has been made in curtailing the practice. The [STOCK Act](https://finbold.com/guide/the-stock-act/), which regulates congressional trading, is violated on a regular basis. Politicians have 45 days to disclose any trade exceeding $1,000 — and the penalty for failing to do so is [a mere $200](https://campaignlegal.org/cases-actions/we-need-stronger-oversight-congressional-stock-trades).

The $200 fine he had to pay was 875,000 times smaller than the sum of his investment. On top of that, while congressional stock trades are reported, the reporting is done in wide ranges — to use the most basic example, a $1,000,000 trade and a $5,000,000 trade fall into the same category, so the exact amounts being invested are obscured.

This attention is driven by the controversies it attracts and the notable success of some lawmakers’ investment strategies. While it is legal for lawmakers to trade stocks, the practice has led to debate due to concerns about the potential misuse of insider information.

Furthermore, Mullin’s inclusion of [Nvidia](https://finbold.com/guide/how-to-buy-nvidia-stock/)(NASDAQ: [NVDA](https://finbold.com/stock/nvidia-stock-nvda/)), the leading name in AI chips, coincided with a period when the stock rallied significantly, dominating the market in 2024. At the same time, the lawmaker has seen notable gains on some of his bets. For instance, as [reported](https://finbold.com/u-s-senator-records-200-return-on-this-suspicious-trade/) by Finbold, Mullin witnessed a 200% return on supermarket chain Sprouts Farmers Market (NASDAQ: [SFM](https://finbold.com/stock/sfm-sprouts-farmers-market)) at one point. This purchase raised questions, as it’s not a typical Congress trade, and concerns regarding the possible use of insider information, considering he sits on the Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works, whose roles might coincide with the industries Sprouts Farmers operates in.

His portfolio includes a stake in [Alphabet](https://finbold.com/guide/how-to-buy-google-stock/) (NASDAQ: [GOOGL](https://finbold.com/stock/alphabet-inc-class-a-common-stock-googl)), Google’s parent company, with key search, AI, and cloud computing businesses. Boozman also holds shares in [Microsoft](https://finbold.com/guide/how-to-buy-microsoft-stock/) (NASDAQ: [MSFT](https://finbold.com/stock/microsoft-msft)), a firm emerging as a key player in the growing AI space. Like Mullin, Boozman has also invested in Applied Materials, possibly aligning with the booming semiconductor sector. In conclusion, while tracking senators’ stock portfolios can provide valuable insights, as always, caution and independent research are necessary, given the ethical complexities surrounding lawmakers’ trading activities.

78058533,This was the most suspicious U.S. politician stock trade in 2024,Finbold has singled out two highly suspicious trades made in 2024 — we leave it to our readers to determine which is the most egregious.,"Although almost universally held to be a conflict between private interests and oaths of office, the practice of U.S. politicians trading stocks is quite widespread. The STOCK Act, passed back in 2012, is the chief piece of legislation regulating congressional trading. However, it is both [violated on a regular basis](https://finbold.com/heres-how-many-times-congress-violated-stock-act-since-new-bill-was-advanced/) and lacks a mechanism to introduce meaningful repercussions. Members of the House of Representatives and the United States Senate have access to information that the public is not privy to. On top of that, they regulate the very industries in which they invest. Unsurprisingly, these advantages manifest as above-average returns. In recent years, many traders have taken to copying the trades made by legislators in an effort to secure those outsized gains for themselves. Picks for you There is no shortage of suspicious trades — every once in a while, a company will announce a new product or some market-moving news will come to light — only for a disclosure released a couple of weeks later to reveal that a U.S. politician invested in the company just before the move to the upside. Finbold has singled out two highly suspicious trades made by politicians in 2024 — we leave it to our readers to determine which is the most egregious. Tina Smith and Tactile Systems (NASDAQ: TCMD) On November 12, Tina Smith, the junior United States Senator from Minnesota, invested between $50,001 and $100,000 in Tactile Systems (NASDAQ: [TCMD](https://finbold.com/stock/tcmd-tactile-systems-technology/)). At the time, TCMD stock was trading at $15.75 — by press time, the price of a Tactile Systems share had risen to $17.13. While the 9.52% return that Smith secured from her investment in TCMD stock isn’t as notable as some of the gains her congressional colleagues have locked in, there are a few additional factors at play that make this a [suspicious trade](https://finbold.com/u-s-politician-just-made-one-of-the-most-suspicious-trades-ever/). The trade was executed by Smith’s husband, Archie — himself an investor who largely focuses on healthcare companies. Tactile Systems, a low-profile, small-cap company with a market share of just $411 million, derives a significant portion of its revenue from government contracts — and the company happens to hail from Minnesota, the state that Tina Smith represents in Congress. In addition, the congresswoman serves on the Senate Committee on Health. Nancy Pelosi’s Visa (NYSE: V) sale Nancy Pelosi is one of the most renowned (or notorious) stock traders in Congress. The former speaker of the house tends to invest in tech companies — over the course of 2024, she has invested millions in [Nvidia](https://finbold.com/guide/how-to-buy-nvidia-stock/) (NASDAQ: [NVDA](https://finbold.com/stock/nvidia-stock-nvda)) and [Broadcom](https://finbold.com/guide/how-to-buy-broadcom-stock/) (NASDAQ: [AVGO](https://finbold.com/stock/avgo-broadcom)). On the other hand, [not all of the representative’s trades pan out](https://finbold.com/end-of-an-era-is-nancy-pelosi-losing-her-stock-market-touch/) — most notably, Pelosi sold [Tesla](https://finbold.com/guide/how-to-buy-tesla-stock/) (NASDAQ: [TSLA](https://finbold.com/stock/tesla-tsla)) too early, locking in significant losses. However, in [early July of 2024](https://finbold.com/nancy-pelosi-dumps-1m-in-this-stock-2-months-before-huge-lawsuit/), the congresswoman sold 2,000 [Visa](https://finbold.com/guide/how-to-buy-visa-stock/) (NYSE: [V](https://finbold.com/stock/visa-v)) shares, worth between $500,001 and $1,000,000. That wouldn’t be suspicious on its own — except that just two months later, Visa faced an [antitrust investigation](https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/justice-department-sues-visa-monopolizing-debit-markets) from the Department of Justice (DOJ). While it’s impossible to know whether or not (and to what extent) Pelosi had an informational edge, the timing of her trade certainly seems impeccable. Interestingly enough, the price of a Visa share has increased by 22.08% over the course of 2024 — while the DOJ case caused prices to dip, the pullback proved to be temporary. Once all is said and done, it’s important to remember that even possessing insider knowledge doesn’t appear to be a guarantee of success — while it does provide a clear advantage, even lawmakers are caught off guard every once in a while. As for which trade was more suspicious — we leave that up to our readers.

78057774,AI builds U.S. politicians stock portfolio for 2025,"Finbold has consulted OpenAI's most advanced model, ChatGPT-4o, to construct a U.S. politician stock portfolio for 2025.","Senators and Representatives tend to secure impressive returns on their investments — most often, they outperform their constituents by quite a large margin. The rules and regulations governing this practice are rather lax, [regularly violated](https://finbold.com/heres-how-many-times-congress-violated-stock-act-since-new-bill-was-advanced/) — and disclosure rules obfuscate the exact amounts being invested. It comes as little surprise that the practice [is controversial](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2022/09/13/us/politics/congress-stock-trading-investigation.html). However, as it is unlikely to change any time soon (despite broad bipartisan support for stricter regulation), and many traders have adopted an ‘if you can’t beat them, join them’ mentality — opting instead to copy or emulate the trades of U.S. politicians to secure better returns. That’s not to say that blindly [following what Congress is doing is](https://finbold.com/guide/how-to-align-your-investments-with-congress-stock-trades/) guaranteed to give good results, however. This isn’t speculation — a well-known trading bot that mimics the investments made by politicians actually [underperformed the S&P 500 in 2024](https://finbold.com/this-trading-bot-copies-us-politicians-trades-heres-its-2024-performance/). There is a way to bolster your returns with insights from Capitol Hill — but it still requires some research and legwork. Picks for you To that end, Finbold has decided to consult one of the most advanced publicly available large language (LLM) models. Here is a portfolio that the right honorable Representative ChatGPT-4o of OpenAI’s 1st congressional district constructed. Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) Semiconductor companies have benefited greatly from the ongoing AI revolution — and [Nvidia](https://finbold.com/guide/how-to-buy-nvidia-stock/) (NASDAQ: [NVDA](https://finbold.com/stock/nvidia-stock-nvda)) has been leading the charge. On a year-to-date (YTD) basis, Nvidia stock has seen prices increase by 178.80% — and plenty of politicians, [including Nancy Pelosi](https://finbold.com/nancy-pelosi-is-up-this-much-on-her-nvidia-nvda-stock-bet/), have made investments in the GPU maker. The AI model highlighted strong demand from data centers, Nvidia’s expanding software ecosystem, and strategic partnerships with cloud giants as catalysts for growth in 2025. Additionally, ChatGPT noted that Nvidia’s dealings in autonomous vehicles and robotics could serve to significantly expand its TAM (total addressable market) in the future. While Nvidia’s upward trajectory has slowed down as of late, and the stock experienced a pullback in December of 2024, this latest development only serves to provide a more attractive price for a long position — provided that investors have the necessary tolerance for risk. Exxon Mobil (NYSE: XOM) [Exxon Mobil](https://finbold.com/guide/how-to-buy-exxonmobil-stock/) (NYSE: [XOM](https://finbold.com/stock/exxon-mobil-stock-xom)) is the largest publicly traded oil company in the world. Oil and gas demand has proven to be unexpectedly robust in spite of the energy transition — and Exxon’s robust financial performance, extensive stock buyback program, and high dividends have managed to attract the attention of investors. On a YTD basis, Exxon Mobil stock has seen prices increase by 11.18%. At the time of writing, the stock was trading at a significant discount, with a forward price-to-earnings (PE) ratio of just 13.4. Representative GPT would opt to invest in XOM shares due to steady global demand for oil and Exxon’s recent investments in low-cost, high-output fields. In addition, the company’s pivot to carbon capture technologies was singled out as a potential long-term boon. ASML Holding (NASDAQ: ASML) Finally, Representative GPT selected [ASML Holding NV](https://finbold.com/guide/how-to-buy-asml-holding-stock/) (NASDAQ: [ASML](https://finbold.com/stock/asml-asml-holding/overview)) as the last part of its portfolio. This Dutch semiconductor company is quite unique — it isn’t engaged in the production or design of chips — rather, ASML makes the equipment that is necessary to produce chips. It’s hard to overstate how crucial ASML is for the wider semiconductor supply chain. The business maintains a monopoly on advanced lithography equipment — without ASML, most of the wider industry would grind to a halt. In spite of that fact, the price of ASML stock has dropped by 3.33% over the course of 2024. The company’s latest earnings report, which was accidentally released ahead of schedule, was rather disappointing. On the bright side, the downward moves mean that the stock is now trading at quite an appealing valuation. The AI model also reflected on ASML’s large backlog — which provides a degree of stability and predictability, as well as a move toward semiconductor self-sufficiency on the part of many countries due to geopolitical instability, as additional factors that could drive growth in 2025. Readers should note the output of AI models — even ones as advanced as ChatGPT, cannot serve as a substitute for due diligence and personal research.

78016929,Marjorie Taylor Greene just updated her stock portfolio,Marjorie Taylor Greene has added two new holdings to her portfolio — a pharma company and a transportation business.,"U.S. politicians have an informational edge over the general public — one which results in, on average, superior returns when compared to their constituents. As controversial as the practice is, curtailing it has proven difficult. With that in mind, traders have resorted to copying the trades of senators and congresspeople, in a bid to emulate their successes in the financial markets. However, blindly following the trades made by lawmakers is far from a guarantee of success. For instance, going long on the 10 most-bought stocks on Capitol Hill would have left investors in the green — but that approach has [underperformed the S&P 500 in 2024](https://finbold.com/this-trading-bot-copies-us-politicians-trades-heres-its-2024-performance/). [Marjorie Taylor Greene](https://finbold.com/guide/marjorie-taylor-greene-net-worth/), the Republican representative of Georgia’s 14th congressional district, is one of the few politicians who have generally seen underwhelming or negative returns on their investments. Picks for you At one point, it became a common joke in online spaces that investors would do well to construct an ‘[inverse Marjorie](https://finbold.com/did-u-s-congress-just-get-its-own-inverse-jim-cramer/)’ portfolio, referencing the longstanding jokes regarding ‘Mad Money’ host Jim Cramer’s [penchant for disastrous stock picks](https://www.businessinsider.com/jim-cramer-investing-lessons-best-worst-trades-stock-market-advice-2022-4), and the ‘[inverse Cramer](https://finbold.com/if-you-put-1000-into-inverse-cramer-etf-at-the-start-of-2024-heres-your-return-now/)’ exchange-traded fund ([ETF](https://finbold.com/etfs/)) that was borne out of them. That perception has shifted throughout the last quarter of 2024, as the congresswoman has made a string of successful trades — [shifting her focus to big tech](https://finbold.com/marjorie-taylor-greene-just-loaded-up-on-these-stocks/). Now, Finbold’s [congressional trading radar](https://finbold.com/trading-signals/congress-trades/) has retrieved a [newly published periodic transaction report](https://disclosures-clerk.house.gov/public_disc/ptr-pdfs/2024/20026473.pdf), which reveals that MTG has once again updated her stock portfolio.

Marjorie Taylor Greene adds exposure to big pharma and transportation All in all, the representative purchased equity in 14 companies — each of the trades was valued at between $1,001 and $15,000. In addition, she invested between $50,001 and $100,000 in U.S. Treasury Bills. In total, this latest filing could cover anywhere from $64,015 to $310,000 in value. Taylor Greene repeated most of her earlier purchases — investing once again in [Nvidia](https://finbold.com/guide/how-to-buy-nvidia-stock/) (NASDAQ: [NVDA](https://finbold.com/stock/nvidia-stock-nvda)), [Meta Platforms](https://finbold.com/guide/how-to-short-meta-stock/) (NASDAQ: [META](https://finbold.com/stock/meta-stock-fb)), [Adobe](https://finbold.com/guide/how-to-buy-adobe-stock/) (NASDAQ: [ADBE](https://finbold.com/stock/adobe-stock-adbe)), and [Amazon](https://finbold.com/guide/how-to-buy-amazon-stock/) (NASDAQ: [AMZN](https://finbold.com/stock/amazon-amzn)). However, the controversial congresswoman also added two new holdings to her portfolio — Mounjaro producer [Eli Lilly](https://finbold.com/guide/how-to-buy-eli-lilly-stock/) (NYSE: [LLY](https://finbold.com/stock/eli-lilly-stock-lly)), and Norfolk Southern (NYSE: [NSC](https://finbold.com/stock/norfolk-southern-stock-nsc)), a railroad transportation company. Although none of her congressional committee assignments are particularly tied to either of those two industries, it’s reasonable to assume that, simply by virtue of being a United States Representative, MTG has at least somewhat of an informational edge. While not as conclusive as some political trades, Marjorie Taylor has been in the green for a while now — so it might be worth mimicking her trades.
