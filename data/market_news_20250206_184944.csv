79219277,"Man charged over sending federal, state MPs antisemitic death threats","A Reservoir man, 33, was charged on Thursday for allegedly contacting a federal MP making death threats and antisemitic comments.","- Breaking [Politics](/politics)[Federal](/politics/federal)[Antisemitism](/topic/antisemitism-1nej) Man charged over sending federal, state MPs antisemitic death threats A federal MP has allegedly received antisemitic death threats from a Victorian man who has been charged and released on bail. The Reservoir man, 33, was charged on Thursday with four counts of using a carriage service to menace, harass or cause offence and one count of using a carriage service to threaten to kill. Both charges carry a maximum penalty of five years. The man also allegedly sent threatening messages to a Victorian state MP. The 33-year-old was granted conditional bail and is scheduled to appear before Melbourne Magistrates Court on Saturday. The AFP will allege the man used social media and email to contact a NSW-based federal MP several times between January 16 and January 18 this year, making death threats and antisemitic comments. Victoria Police will also allege the man used social media to contact a Victorian-based state MP last month. The threats put the safety of politicians back in the spotlight, after a number of federal and state MPs [had their offices vandalised](/link/follow-20170101-p5ki3e) with [antisemitic graffiti last year](/link/follow-20170101-p5jmye). AFP counterterrorism and special investigations command assistant commissioner Stephen Nutt said the police were tirelessly investigating antisemitic conduct under special operation Avalite. “Parliamentarians and members of our community should not have to endure vile threats based on their race, religion, or ethnicity,” he said in a statement. “The community should expect further charges ... Special Operation Avalite has a number of individuals under investigation.” Vandals smashing windows and using flammable liquid to set fires at [the office of Jewish Labor MP Josh Burns in June last year](/link/follow-20170101-p5jmye) was a recent example of a politician being targeted by antisemitism. Labor MP Peter Khalil also had his [electorate office in Melbourne’s northern suburbs targeted](/link/follow-20170101-p5ki3e). Federal parliament this week was dominated by how the Albanese government was addressing the rise in antisemitism, as Labor introduced mandatory jail sentences for terror and Nazi-related offences – defying the party’s own policy platform against mandatory sentences. Last month, it was revealed police discovered a caravan in the northern Sydney suburb of Dural. The caravan contained a note with the address of a Sydney synagogue and enough stolen explosives to create a 40-metre blast wave. The announcement shocked the country as it was thought Anthony Albanese found out about the caravan at the same time as the public, and the prime minister [repeatedly refused to answer questions](/link/follow-20170101-p5l8wd) about whether he had been briefed on the matter. Opposition Leader Peter Dutton said on Thursday he had written to Albanese asking for an independent inquiry into the communications between security agencies, police and the government over the caravan discovery. Albanese argued instead it was more important to track down the perpetrators. Federal Police Commissioner Reece Kershaw also came under intense lines of questioning before a hearing of the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Law Enforcement on Thursday, [as he refused to answer](/link/follow-20170101-p5l9z1) whether he briefed Albanese before the caravan discovery was leaked to the media. “I am conscious that this is a public hearing and it’s not an appropriate forum for us to provide information relating to an ongoing investigation,” Kershaw said on Thursday.

In this article, we are going to take a look at where ChipMOS TECHNOLOGIES INC.","We recently compiled a list of the [35 Chip Stocks In Focus Amid Tech Selloff](https://www.insidermonkey.com/blog/35-chip-stocks-in-focus-amid-tech-selloff-1444499/). In this article, we are going to take a look at where ChipMOS TECHNOLOGIES INC. (NASDAQ:IMOS) stands against the other chip stocks. The semiconductor industry is on a trajectory of rapid growth, with global revenues expected to exceed $1 trillion by 2030. According to a report on the industry by professional services firm PwC, this expansion is fueled by advancements in memory technology, the rise of automotive semiconductors, regional self-sufficiency initiatives, purpose-built silicon, and the increasing demand for artificial intelligence (AI) applications. Per the report, Memory integrated circuits (ICs), particularly DRAM and high-bandwidth memory (HBM), have been the fastest-growing semiconductor segment. In 2024, DRAM is projected to contribute 14% of total semiconductor revenue. HBM, essential for AI and high-performance computing (HPC), is expected to grow at a 64% compound annual growth rate (CAGR) in bit growth and a 58% CAGR in revenue through 2028. As big companies leverage HBM for AI workloads, closer collaboration is required between foundries and memory firms to integrate logic and memory components effectively.

NORTHFIELD, NH — A man from Concord was arrested on multiple charges Thursday afternoon, accused of wrong-way impaired driving, through several communities along Interstate 93. Around 4 p.m., New Hampshire State Police began receiving reports about a pickup truck traveling north in the highway’s southbound lanes, just north of Exit 16 in Concord. Troopers began to coordinate with local agencies attempting to slow traffic along the snow-covered highway while looking for the reported wrong-way driver, according to Tyler Dumont, the public information officer for the department. More reports came in about the vehicle when a trooper encountered the pickup truck, still driving in the wrong direction. “The trooper’s emergency lights were fully activated,” Dumont said. “However, the driver failed to stop and drove around the trooper and a line of other vehicles.” Find out what's happening in Concordfor free with the latest updates from Patch.

Find out what's happening in Concordfor free with the latest updates from Patch. About 15 minutes later, a trooper, near Mile Marker 52 in Northfield, stopped traffic on the highway and blocked the right and breakdown lane while deploying spike strips in the left lane. The driver drove the pickup truck over the strips and “eventually stopped in the high-speed lane,” Dumont said. The driver, Matthew Burt, 33, of Concord, was arrested [on aggravated driving under the influence](https://patch.com/new-hampshire/concord-nh/convicted-concord-thief-arrested-another-theft-charge-log), two counts of felony reckless conduct with a deadly weapon, two counts of conduct after an accident, disobeying an officer, and reckless operation charges as well as a driving an unregistered vehicle violation. He was held in the Merrimack County Jail, pending arraignment. Dumont said EMTs evaluated the drivers of two other vehicles struck during the incident as a precaution. State police also searched the area to ensure no more than two vehicles were struck during the incident, according to scanner chatter. “The New Hampshire State Police would like to thank the many witnesses who contributed to the safe resolution of this incident,” Dumont said, “in addition to assistance from members of the Canterbury, Northfield, and Tilton police departments.” Anyone with additional information to assist the investigation was asked to contact Trooper Ben Olmstead at benjamin.m.olmstead@dos.nh.gov.

The [first-time Oscar nominee](https://nypost.com/2025/01/23/entertainment/oscar-nominations-2025-see-the-full-list-of-nominees/) touched on her relationship with Willis, 69, as they approach 25 years of being divorced. “We will always be a family, just in a different form,” Moore said of Willis, who was [diagnosed with frontotemporal dementia](https://nypost.com/2023/02/16/bruce-willis-family-reveals-cruel-dementia-diagnosis/) in 2023 following an aphasia diagnosis the year before that [caused him to retire from acting](https://nypost.com/2022/03/30/bruce-willis-stepping-away-from-acting-due-to-aphasia/). The famous exes share daughters Rumer, 36, Scout, 33 and Tallulah, 31, and one granddaughter, Louetta. “For me, there was never a question. I show up because that’s what you do for the people you love,” “The Substance” actress shared. She wasn’t just talking about her ex. Moore visits Willis every week, according to Variety. She also serves as a pillar of support for his wife of nearly 16 years, Emma Heming Willis, 46, and the couple’s two daughters: Mabel, 12, and Evelyn, 10. Moore shared that she hopes their situation can inspire others. “I hope it’s encouraging for others to see that there’s a different way to do things,” Moore said of her relationship with Willis. “There is life after divorce. There is a way to co-parent with love.” The actress [recently spoke about her ex-husband](https://nypost.com/2024/12/06/entertainment/demi-moore-gives-rare-update-on-bruce-willis-dementia-battle/), echoing her desire to stay a tight-knit family despite their divorce. “That has been very important to me even from when Bruce and I separated and divorced, is the recognition that we’re a family, and we’ll always be a family, just in a different form,” Moore told CNN in December. She also [gave a rare update on his dementia battle](https://nypost.com/2024/12/06/entertainment/demi-moore-gives-rare-update-on-bruce-willis-dementia-battle/). “Given the givens, he’s in a very stable place at the moment,” she stated last year. “And I’ve shared this before, but I really mean this so sincerely. It’s so important for anybody who’s dealing with this to really meet them where they’re at, and from that place, there is such loving and joy.” Moore explained that it’s “very difficult” to watch someone you love struggle, adding it’s “not what I would wish upon anyone.” However, the actress said the family is staying positive and embracing Willis’ state. “There is great loss, but there is also great beauty and gifts that can come from it,” she told the outlet. Moore and Willis tied the knot in 1987 and announced their separation over a decade later in 1998. They settled their divorce in 2000. Following their split, the “Die Hard” star opened up about his close relationship with Moore. “I still love Demi. We’re very close. We have three children whom we will continue to raise together, and we’re probably as close now as we ever were. We realize we have a lifelong commitment to our kids. Our friendship continues. The institution has been set aside,” he told Rolling Stone. Moore is coming off her most successful year yet. She [won the Golden Globe for Best Actress](https://nypost.com/2025/01/06/entertainment/demi-moores-family-freaks-out-over-her-first-acting-win-in-45-year-career-at-golden-globes-2025/) for “The Substance,” the first of her 45-year career.

A class action lawsuit has already been filed. If you wish to serve as lead plaintiff, you must move the Court no later than February 25, 2025. A lead plaintiff is a representative party acting on behalf of other class members in directing the litigation. WHY ROSEN LAW: We encourage investors to select qualified counsel with a track record of success in leadership roles. Often, firms issuing notices do not have comparable experience, resources, or any meaningful peer recognition. Many of these firms do not actually litigate securities class actions, but are merely middlemen that refer clients or partner with law firms that actually litigate the cases. Be wise in selecting counsel. The Rosen Law Firm represents investors throughout the globe, concentrating its practice in securities class actions and shareholder derivative litigation. Rosen Law Firm has achieved the largest ever securities class action settlement against a Chinese Company at the time. Rosen Law Firm was Ranked No. 1 by ISS Securities Class Action Services for number of securities class action settlements in 2017. The firm has been ranked in the top 4 each year since 2013 and has recovered hundreds of millions of dollars for investors. In 2019 alone the firm secured over $438 million for investors. In 2020, founding partner Laurence Rosen was named by law360 as a Titan of Plaintiffs’ Bar. Many of the firm’s attorneys have been recognized by Lawdragon and Super Lawyers. DETAILS OF THE CASE: According to the lawsuit, throughout the Class Period, defendants made false and misleading statements and/or failed to disclose that: (1) the impact of project delays on Nextracker’s business, financial results, and prospects was far more severe than represented to investors; (2) permitting and interconnection delays had materially impaired Nextracker’s ability to convert backlog into revenue at historical conversion rates; (3) Nextracker had been unable to offset the negative impact from project delays through increased client demand and the purported ability to pull forward its other projects in the manner represented by defendants; (4) Nextracker did not possess the competitive advantages which purportedly shielded it from industry-wide headwinds or the ability to effectively offset the adverse effects of project delays as claimed by defendants; and (5) as a result of the above, defendants lacked a reasonable basis for their positive statements about Nextracker’s business, financial results, and prospects. When the true details entered the market, the lawsuit claims that investors suffered damages.

[website](https://www.usaid.gov/) said “all USAID direct hire personnel will be placed on administrative leave globally,” by the end of this week “with the exception of designated personnel responsible for mission-critical functions, core leadership and specially designated programs.” For USAID personnel stationed abroad, the notice said the agency is working with the State Department on a plan to arrange and pay for their return travel to the United States within 30 days. Contractors whose work is not deemed as essential will be laid off. According to a Congressional [report](https://crsreports.congress.gov/product/pdf/IF/IF10261) published in January, USAID’s direct hire workforce “totals more than 10,000, with approximately two-thirds serving overseas.” [According to](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/04/us/usaid-musk-trump-rubio-cuts.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share&referringSource=articleShare) the New York Times, the notice was published after roughly 1,400 U.S.-based USAID staffers were informed about being put on indefinite administrative leave which will remain in place until they were “otherwise notified.” Several of USAID’s social media handles also appear to have been purged, as its [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/usaid/#), [X](https://x.com/USAID) and [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/user/usaidvideo) pages are no longer accessible.

[CBS News](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/usaid-merged-into-state-department/) reported Monday that USAID will be merged with the State Department and will have “significant cuts in the workforce, but it will remain a humanitarian aid entity.” [ABC News reported](https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/live-updates/trump-second-term-live-updates/?id=118389757) the president—whose administration has been seemingly [moving toward](https://www.reuters.com/world/us/trump-administration-explores-bringing-usaid-under-state-department-sources-say-2025-01-31/) putting USAID under the control of the State Department—appointed Rubio to temporarily lead the independent organization.

Joni Ernst, R-Iowa, who was also on the stream, said if there are “truly good pro-American programs” under USAID’s authority they should be moved under the State Department and “make sure we have proper oversight.” Get Forbes Breaking News Text Alerts: We’re launching text message alerts so you'll always know the biggest stories shaping the day’s headlines.

Earlier on Sunday evening, Trump was asked by reporters about the state of USAID and said: “Well it's been run by a bunch of radical lunatics, and we're getting them out...and then we'll make a decision.” Crucial Quote “There are a lot of functions of USAID that are going to continue, that are going to be part of American foreign policy, but it has to be aligned with American foreign policy,” Rubio [told](https://x.com/ReshadHudson/status/1886468535662080405) reporters Monday. “Every dollar we spend and every program we fund ... will be aligned with the national interest of the United States, and USAID has a history of sort of ignoring that and deciding that they’re somehow a global charity.” What Is Usaid? USAID is the primary international humanitarian aid and development branch of the U.S. government, and is operated both as an “independent establishment” and under “the direct authority and policy guidance of the Secretary of State,” and each administration has taken its own approach to how that should look, according to the [Congressional Research Service](https://crsreports.congress.gov/product/pdf/IF/IF10261). The organization was established in 1961 and provides assistance to countries and leads U.S. efforts against poverty, disease and humanitarian need. In fiscal year 2023, the agency had more than 10,000 employees, managed more than $40 billion in appropriations and gave assistance to about 130 countries. What To Know About Doge’s Clash With Usaid? Operatives from the Department of Government Efficiency, which Musk leads, were reportedly stopped by senior USAID security officials while [trying to access materials](https://www.forbes.com/sites/alisondurkee/2025/02/02/what-to-know-about-trumps-usaid-changes-after-elon-musks-doge-accesses-classified-info/) at the aid agency’s office, including classified information. [According to](https://edition.cnn.com/2025/02/02/politics/usaid-officials-leave-musk-doge/index.html) CNN, the two USAID officials were placed on administrative leave on Saturday and the DOGE operatives were ultimately able to access the classified materials despite lacking the appropriate security clearances. Musk responded to CNN’s report by calling USAID a “criminal organization” without any evidence and adding that it was “time for it to die.” Did Elon Musk’s Spacex Work With Usaid? Forbes [reported](https://www.forbes.com/sites/thomasbrewster/2025/02/03/usaid-and-musk-were-partners-via-spacex-starlink/) on Monday that USAID spent up to $1 million on SpaceX’s Starlink terminals over the last four years, according to federal contract records, and brought the satellite terminals to countries including Zimbabwe and South Africa. On April 5, 2022, USAID [announced](https://archive.is/NNwNx) it delivered 5,000 Starlink satellite terminals to Ukraine through a “public-private partnership” with SpaceX, Musk’s aerospace company. The terminals were designed to allow officials and service providers to continue communicating with Ukraine amid its war with Russia, was impacting cellular communication infrastructure. Two years later, on May 14, 2024, the USAID Office of Inspector General said it was initiating an inspection of USAID’s oversight of the terminals it provided to the Ukrainian government. The inspection sought to determine how Ukraine used the terminals and how USAID monitored their usage, according to an agency page accessed on the WayBackMachine. Key Background The USAID website [went offline](https://www.forbes.com/sites/conormurray/2025/02/01/usaid-website-appears-to-be-offline-as-trump-administration-reportedly-moves-to-put-it-under-state-department-control/) on Saturday afternoon amid a push by the Trump administration to bring the independent aid agency under the direct control of the State Department. Trump’s recent actions—including an order to freeze most foreign aid—have triggered confusion and uncertainty at the agency over the past week as staffers feared an impending shutdown. Several of the agency’s signs were taken down from its Washington D.C. offices on Friday, NBC News [reported](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/donald-trump/usaid-future-remains-uncertain-funding-freeze-trump-rcna190287). Global aid groups have [warned](https://www.amnestyusa.org/press-releases/abrupt-collapse-of-usaid-would-put-human-rights-of-millions-at-greater-risk/) that shutting down USAID and a halt on U.S. foreign aid may have a catastrophic humanitarian impact across the world.

[News](https://www.techradar.com/news) Google CEO hints you may not have a choice unless you pay up - Google CEO Sundar Pichai is teasing that Gemini could one day feature advertisements. - It tracks as Google is pretty crafty at inserting ads into most of its offerings - You can already see hints of ads in AI overviews in Google Search [Google](https://www.techradar.com/tag/google)’s Gemini AI might not have ads today, but let’s be real: the idea that Google is looking to bring advertising to AI assistants is hardly surprising. Google has spent decades fine-tuning the art of turning eyeballs into revenue, and Gemini may be next in line, according to CEO Sundar Pichai. During Alphabet’s latest investor call, Pichai gave a not-so-subtle hint that while you can use Gemini for free or pay for a subscription to extra features, advertising will likely come along to boost the company's bottom line in some way. Google Gemini doesn't have banner ads popping up mid-conversation at the moment, but it doesn't take much imagination to picture a time when ads will support the free version of Gemini, and the premium subscription will count its lack of advertisements as one of its perks. It makes sense. AI isn’t cheap to run, and Google has already announced plans to spend $75 billion this year to keep up in the AI race. That kind of money doesn’t grow on trees; it grows on ad revenue. ""On the monetization side, obviously, for now, we are focused on a free tier and subscriptions. But obviously, as you've seen in Google over time, we always want to lead with user experience. And we do have very good ideas for native ad concepts, but you'll see us lead with the user experience,"" Pichai [said](https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=92X363&xcust=trdpro_us_8362764261115055943&xs=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.fool.com%2Fearnings%2Fcall-transcripts%2F2025%2F02%2F05%2Falphabet-goog-q4-2024-earnings-call-transcript%2F&sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.techradar.com%2Fcomputing%2Fartificial-intelligence%2Fwould-you-use-google-gemini-if-it-fills-with-ads) during the call. ""But I do think we're always committed to making the products work and reach billions of users at scale. And advertising has been a great aspect of that strategy. And so, just like you've seen with [YouTube](https://www.techradar.com/tag/youtube), we'll give people options over time."" Ads AI If you want a preview of how ads might sneak into Gemini, just look at Google’s AI Overviews.

Search for “best ways to remove grass stains,” and in the AI-generated blurb, you might see a nice little link to buy a specific detergent. It's not exactly subtle. Google has spent years mastering the art of blending ads into everyday searches, and there’s no reason to believe it won’t do the same with its AI [chatbot](https://www.techradar.com/tag/chatbot). Ads through AI are not a unique Google idea, of course. [Microsoft ](https://www.techradar.com/tag/microsoft)has been playing with ads in its Copilot AI [chatbot](https://www.techradar.com/tag/chatbot), as has [Perplexity](https://www.techradar.com/news/this-siri-replacement-may-be-the-closest-thing-to-having-chatgpt-on-your-iphone) with its [sponsored](https://www.techradar.com/computing/artificial-intelligence/get-ready-for-ai-to-serve-google-search-style-ads) follow-up questions.

If Gemini starts recommending products based on your conversations, will you still want to converse with the AI? Mid-chat sponsored messages might annoy anyone into opting out, but maybe you'll be okay with an ad at the bottom of your chat window.

79219164,Celtics Quickly Make Good On Brad Stevens' Declaration,"A day after trading Jaden Springer, the Celtics again meet the requirement of having 14 players on standard contracts, signing a player at their primary position of need.","Before the Boston Celtics' hosted the Dallas Mavericks, the franchise's president of basketball operations, Brad Stevens, said the team intended to add a wing to bolster its hopes of lifting the Larry O'Brien Trophy for the second straight year. They'd be the first franchise to do so since the 2017-18 Golden State Warriors. Stevens, who also addressed [the role the sale of the Celtics is having on roster building](https://www.forbes.com/sites/bobbykrivitsk/2025/02/06/brad-stevens-sheds-light-on-the-impact-of-celtics-sale/), quickly made good on his declaration. Boston has signed forward Torrey Craig, [a move first reported](https://x.com/ShamsCharania/status/1887673672862744868) by ESPN's Shams Charania. Craig is a big wing, the Celtics' primary need. The six-foot-seven forward is a two-way player who has shot near or over 40 percent from beyond the arc each of the last three seasons at a volume ranging from 2.9 to 3.9 in the nine games he's played this season. The seven-year veteran is a physical and versatile defender who will also contribute on the boards when called upon. Craig averages 4.0 rebounds per game for his career and grabbed 4.1 per contest in 53 appearances last season. The Chicago Bulls, who at 22-30, occupy the 10th seed, the final spot in the Eastern Conference play-in tournament, recently waived Craig, who has not played since December due to a leg injury. The 34-year-old averaged 6.9 points and 2.8 rebounds in the nine games he suited up for the Bulls this season. The Celtics again meet the requirement of having at least 14 players signed to standard contracts. [They traded Jaden Springer to the Houston Rockets](https://www.forbes.com/sites/bobbykrivitsk/2025/01/31/the-celtics-should-retain-defensive-spark-plug-past-the-trade-deadline/) on Wednesday. The latter has since waived the 22-year-old guard. Boston also sent a 2030 second-round pick and a protected 2027 second-round selection to Houston. In exchange, they received a protected 2031 second-round pick. Before news of the Celtics signing Torrey Craig broke, when asked about the prospect of converting Drew Peterson or JD Davison from a two-way deal to a standard contract, which could still happen since Boston has an open roster spot, Stevens conveyed the following. ""We have 13 guys right now. We'll probably do something with a 14th relatively soon, and then we'll take our time with the 15th and really assess our health and needs and those type of things as we go on. And, (I) won't get into any particular players, (but) I think all of our guys have done a great job.

Traders are awaiting key US labor market data, including [Nonfarm Payrolls](https://www.fxstreet.com/macroeconomics/economic-indicator/nfp) (NFP), which could influence the Federal Reserve’s (Fed) monetary policy direction. However, Silver's upside appears limited as the US Dollar (USD) extends its recovery amid rebounding US Treasury yields.

Safe-haven metals like Silver have gained ground amid heightened risk aversion due to global trade and economic uncertainties. However, trade negotiations between the United States (US) and China could temper this sentiment. US President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping are set to discuss potential tariff rollbacks, which could ease market concerns and limit Silver’s upside. Diminished fears of a US-China trade war also reduce the risk of rising US inflation, reinforcing expectations of two [Federal Reserve](https://www.fxstreet.com/macroeconomics/central-banks/fed) rate cuts this year. As a non-yielding asset, [Silver](https://www.fxstreet.com/rates-charts/xagusd) benefits from a dovish stance by major central banks. Meanwhile, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) is expected to announce a 25-basis-point rate cut on Friday. Last week, the [European Central Bank](https://www.fxstreet.com/macroeconomics/central-banks/ecb) (ECB) lowered its Deposit Facility Rate by 25 basis points to 2.75%, while the People’s Bank of China (PBoC) has signaled potential rate cuts. Additionally, the Bank of Canada (BoC) has paused its quantitative tightening, and Sweden’s Riksbank has cut interest [rates](https://www.fxstreet.com/rates-charts/rates). Silver FAQs Silver is a precious metal highly traded among investors. It has been historically used as a store of value and a medium of exchange. Although less popular than Gold, traders may turn to Silver to diversify their investment portfolio, for its intrinsic value or as a potential hedge during high-inflation periods. Investors can buy physical Silver, in coins or in bars, or trade it through vehicles such as Exchange Traded Funds, which track its price on international markets. Silver prices can move due to a wide range of factors. Geopolitical instability or fears of a deep recession can make Silver price escalate due to its safe-haven status, although to a lesser extent than Gold's. As a yieldless asset, Silver tends to rise with lower interest rates. Its moves also depend on how the US Dollar (USD) behaves as the asset is priced in dollars (XAG/USD). A strong Dollar tends to keep the price of Silver at bay, whereas a weaker Dollar is likely to propel prices up. Other factors such as investment demand, mining supply – Silver is much more abundant than Gold – and recycling rates can also affect prices. Silver is widely used in industry, particularly in sectors such as electronics or solar energy, as it has one of the highest electric conductivity of all metals – more than Copper and Gold. A surge in demand can increase prices, while a decline tends to lower them. Dynamics in the US, Chinese and Indian economies can also contribute to price swings: for the US and particularly China, their big industrial sectors use Silver in various processes; in India, consumers’ demand for the precious metal for jewellery also plays a key role in setting prices. Silver prices tend to follow Gold's moves. When Gold prices rise, Silver typically follows suit, as their status as safe-haven assets is similar. The Gold/Silver ratio, which shows the number of ounces of Silver needed to equal the value of one ounce of Gold, may help to determine the relative valuation between both metals. Some investors may consider a high ratio as an indicator that Silver is undervalued, or Gold is overvalued. On the contrary, a low ratio might suggest that Gold is undervalued relative to Silver.

[Hong Kong](/topic/hong-kong)'s post office announced late Thursday it would continue to suspend shipping items containing goods to the United States until further notice, despite its American counterpart having reversed its ban on packages from the city and other parts of [China](/topic/china). The Hong Kong government said in a statement that Hongkong Post was in talks with the U.S. postal administration but further clarification was still needed on certain matters, including over a tariff. It reiterated its strong disapproval over the U.S. imposition of additional duty on Hong Kong products, urging the U.S. to take “urgent actions to rectify its wrongdoing.""

It reversed course Wednesday but gave no reason, saying it would work with [Customs and Border Protection](/topic/customs-and-border-protection) to implement a collection process for the new tariffs to avoid delivery disruptions. Although the ban was short-lived and the U-turn came within the same day for those who live in Hong Kong time zone, it confused those who wanted to post to the U.S. from the trading hub. It also sparked concerns over the potential impact on online shopping platforms like Shein and Temu, popular with younger shoppers in the U.S. for cheap clothing and other products, usually shipped directly from China. Cheap, direct postal service helps these companies keep costs low, as did the “de minimis” exemption that previously allowed shipments to go tax-free if their value is under $800.

In this article, we are going to take a look at where The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS) stands against the other stocks Jim Cramer recently talked about. Jim Cramer, the host of Mad Money, took a moment on Wednesday to reflect on the latest market developments as earnings season progresses, sharing his thoughts on how investors can identify stocks that are unfairly punished and present solid buying opportunities. “This market has the memory of a mayfly that creates a ton of opportunities so… I want to help you find them.” READ ALSO [Jim Cramer Shed Light on These 8 Stocks Recently](https://www.insidermonkey.com/blog/jim-cramer-shed-light-on-these-8-stocks-recently-1443733/) and [12 Stocks on Jim Cramer’s Radar](https://www.insidermonkey.com/blog/12-stocks-on-jim-cramers-radar-1442931/) Cramer stressed that time and again, he has seen growth stocks severely impacted by minor bits of bad news, such as small downgrades or slight concerns about a quarter’s performance. In these cases, he noted, the punishment rarely fits the crime, if a real issue even exists. Cramer also recently weighed in on the ongoing trade tensions with China. He urged Wall Street to start taking President Trump’s policies more seriously, pointing out that Trump had negotiated a deal that granted China a much lower tariff than Canada received. Cramer dismissed the idea that China’s response was an equal counterattack, calling such a notion “nonsense” and “idiocy.” He added: “Now, if Wall Street took Trump seriously, they’d know that China played softball with its retaliation just like Trump played softball with that 10% tariff.” He elaborated that much of the recent panic, which had escalated on Sunday night, shifted a bit to optimism, as people began to realize that the president had managed to negotiate a deal. Acknowledging the presence of hardliners within the White House who are keen on taking a tougher stance on China, Cramer noted that those individuals had lost the battle. He pointed out that Trump’s objective was to broker a deal that could generate revenue for the U.S. Treasury while providing American businesses with opportunities in China. Cramer emphasized that this goal should have been clear to anyone who had been watching the Chinese stock market, as stocks that trade in China surged recently. Our Methodology For this article, we compiled a list of 13 stocks that were discussed by Jim Cramer during the episode of Mad Money on February 5. We listed the stocks in the order that Cramer mentioned them. We also provided hedge fund sentiment for each stock as of the third quarter of 2024, which was taken from Insider Monkey’s database of 900 hedge funds. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points ([see more details here](https://www.insidermonkey.com/premium/newsletters/quarterly)). The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:[DIS](https://www.insidermonkey.com/insider-trading/company/walt%20disney%20co/1744489/)) Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 76 Starting his list of solid buying opportunities in the stock market these days, Cramer mentioned The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS) and said: “This morning, for instance, Disney reported. It was a terrific quarter, theme parks, much better than expected, movies, fantastic, TV sports, real positive but there was this one line involving Disney’s streaming property. When it raised prices, there were some churn and subscribers dropped by 1%. Oh no, the genius traders said to themselves, Netflix had no churn when it raised prices, so let’s bury this stock. These wise men and women sold Disney down into oblivion, not thinking about two things. One, Netflix is a beast, the best of the best without compare. And two, Netflix doesn’t have parks or cruise ships or even a fraction of Disney’s intellectual property. I bet that in a few weeks, people will forget why they sold Disney stock down, and the stock, it will be higher.” The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS) manages a wide range of businesses, including film and TV production, streaming services, and theme park operations. Cramer has been bullish on the stock for some time and in January, he commented: “Disney, I turned to Jeff Marks today, it was at $106, I said, when should we buy back that stock that we sold much higher? I think you got a great price today. I think Disney is a remarkable company and people are selling it because of the fires in Los Angeles. I feel horrible about what’s happening in Los Angeles, but I do not think the franchise of Disney is gonna be down for long very much.” Overall DIS ranks 1st on our list of the stocks Jim Cramer highlighted recently. While we acknowledge the potential of DIS as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than DIS but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the [cheapest AI stock](https://www.insidermonkey.com/blog/undervalued-ai-stock-poised-for-massive-gains-10000-upside-17/?forcedCTACode=PR4SJ).

No cuts have been made to the aid agency as of this writing. However, the [New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/live/2025/02/06/us/president-trump-news/usaid-job-cuts?smid=url-share) reports that the Trump administration hopes to keep just 290 or so of the agency's staffers after downsizing. [USAID](https://www.salon.com/topic/usaid) currently employs more than 10,000 workers coordinating U.S. global aid efforts. USAID Assistant Administrator Atul Gawande shared an email that appeared to be from acting USAID Deputy Chief of Staff Joel Borkert on social media. A chart within the email seemed to corroborate the Times’ claims of massive staffing cuts. Gawande slammed potential mass layoffs in a series of social media posts, saying that the Trump admin's ""utter indifference"" to the consequences of their actions is ""evil."" “These people worked selflessly for their country in some of Earth's most impoverished or dangerous places under GOP and Dems alike,” he wrote. “The utter indifference to loss of life, our people abroad, America's standing, and American security, caused by unchecked, reckless power, is evil.” Trump officials have launched multiple assaults on the agency behind crucial and popular global civilian aid initiatives in the opening days of the new administration.

And they have imperiled U.S. national security interests,” [the complaint](https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.dcd.277213/gov.uscourts.dcd.277213.1.0.pdf) alleges. “Not a single one of defendants’ actions to dismantle USAID were taken pursuant to congressional authorization.” Read more about this topic",salon.com,https://www.salon.com/2025/02/06/this-is-evil-usaid-will-reportedly-be-gutted-by-administration/,[],"['All Salon', 'Doge', 'Donald Trump', 'Elon Musk', 'In Brief', 'Marco Rubio', 'News &Amp', 'Politics', 'Tiingo Top', 'Usaid']",2025-02-06,2025-02-06,0,10,71,108,2979

79219120,Life After VMware: Which Alternative Is Right For You?,"VMware customers see Broadcom’s actions as an opportunity to rethink virtualization, cloud strategy and modernization efforts. Here's how to look at VMware alternatives.","It has been over a year since Broadcom finalized its $61 billion acquisition of VMware, and the aftershocks are still rippling across the IT landscape. Once the gold standard for enterprise virtualization, VMware is now at the center of a mass exodus. Customers are scrambling for VMware alternatives or reluctantly accepting Broadcom’s new rules. Between steep [price hikes](https://www.forbes.com/sites/stevemcdowell/2023/12/21/why-your-costs-may-go-up-with-vmwares-cheaper-new-bundles/), mandatory long-term contracts, and a [shrinking partner ecosystem](https://www.forbes.com/sites/emilsayegh/2024/04/09/navigating-the-new-vmware-landscape-post-broadcom-acquisition/), VMware customers face tough choices. Some are doubling down and paying up, while others are plotting their escape. Despite an unhappy VMware customer base, Broadcom is thriving. In its most [recent earnings](https://investors.broadcom.com/news-releases/news-release-details/broadcom-inc-announces-fourth-quarter-and-fiscal-year-2024), the company posted record revenues of $51.6 billion, with $2.7 billion coming from software sales. Broadcom is betting that, despite rising costs, enterprises will still choose VMware over competing solutions. However, that gamble is far from certain, with mounting competition from alternative hypervisors, open-source platforms, and public-cloud specific solutions. For enterprises navigating this uncertainty, the challenge isn’t just finding a replacement for VMware. IT shops of all sizes see Broadcom’s actions as an opportunity to rethink their approach to virtualization, cloud strategy, and IT modernization. The Growing Demand for VMware Alternatives For many VMware customers, the shift isn’t just about cost — it’s about risk. Broadcom’s moves over the past year have raised concerns among IT leaders that they may soon face fewer choices and diminishing support. Recent high-profile migrations and analyst recommendations highlight the growing demand for alternatives: - Rackspace is testing a [migration](https://www.theregister.com/2025/02/05/rackspace_vmware_planet9_migration/)of 3,000 VMs away from VMware to explore whether an alternative private cloud solution can replace it. - Beeks Group has begun moving more than 20,000 virtual machines away from VMware, citing a [tenfold increase](https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2024/12/company-claims-1000-percent-price-hike-drove-it-from-vmware-to-open-source-rival/)in its VMware license renewal costs as a key motivator. - Gartner [warns](https://www.networkworld.com/article/3813523/thinking-of-moving-off-vmware-gartner-tallies-cost-of-large-scale-vmware-migration.html#:~:text=Gartner%20analysis%20shows%20the%20cost,other%20operational%20expenses%20are%20calculated.)that migration won’t be easy—or cheap—but it may be the only viable move for organizations wary of long-term uncertainty. These are not isolated cases. Search interest in “VMware alternatives” has surged, and analyst firms are fielding more inquiries from businesses evaluating migration strategies. Recent urveys from Civo and CloudBold indicate that over half of VMware customers are actively exploring alternative solutions. The biggest drivers are rising costs, restrictive licensing, and the fear of vendor lock-in under Broadcom's control. However, moving away from VMware is no simple task. Enterprises must weigh migration complexity, integration challenges, and the long-term viability of their chosen alternative. The decision isn’t just about cost savings — it’s about aligning IT strategy with the future of hybrid cloud, containerization, and AI-driven workloads. Top Alternatives to VMware Not every VMware customer needs to migrate, and those satisfied with Broadcom’s platform may opt to stay. However, for organizations exploring alternatives, several strong contenders offer unique advantages: - Public Cloud Providers: CSPs like AWS, Microsoft Azure, and Google Cloud all offer scalability and automation but come with vendor lock-in risks and migration complexity. They are best suited for organizations prioritizing cloud-native modernization over traditional virtualization. - Microsoft Hyper-V & Azure Stack HCI: These are ideal for businesses already invested in the Microsoft ecosystem. However, Hyper-V's feature set does not fully match VMware's, and Azure Stack HCI's hardware requirements may be a limiting factor. - Red Hat OpenShift Virtualization: Appeals to organizations embracing containers and Kubernetes. While powerful, the learning curve and migration complexity may deter traditional virtualization users. - Nutanix Cloud Infrastructure: The closest direct alternative to VMware, Nutanix provides a salutation based on a hyperconverged architecture that simplifies migration and hybrid-cloud operations. Its support for both traditional and modern IT architectures, along with [deep collaborations](https://nand-research.com/research-note-dell-nutanix-expand-relationship-offerings/)with OEMs like Dell Technologies, make it a preferred choice for enterprises seeking a smooth transition and future-proof investment. Unlike past IT disruptions, where a single dominant player emerged, this transition may lead to a more diversified market, with different solutions catering to specific business needs. Analyst’s Take VMware dominated enterprise virtualization for years, deeply embedding itself into IT operations. While hybrid cloud, containerization, and AI-driven workloads had already begun to challenge VMware’s stronghold, inertia and familiarity kept enterprises loyal. Now, financial and operational uncertainty is forcing a shift. Organizations are no longer just considering alternatives—they’re actively adopting them. This is not merely a reaction to cost increases but a fundamental change in enterprise IT priorities. Broadcom’s strategy has accelerated an existing trend: the growing emphasis on strategic flexibility and multi-cloud readiness. For IT leaders, remaining on VMware without reassessment carries significant risk. Broadcom has made it clear that revenue optimization takes precedence over customer satisfaction. If this trend continues, enterprises that fail to develop an exit strategy may be locked into an increasingly costly and restrictive environment. That said, enterprises have more options than ever before. Organizations must carefully evaluate their next steps, whether moving to the public cloud, adopting a hybrid model, transitioning to a new hypervisor, or staying with VMware. This shift is already creating winners. Nutanix, Microsoft Hyper-V, Azure Stack HCI, and Red Hat OpenShift Virtualization are emerging as viable competitors. Each of these offer distinct advantages based on business needs and strategic direction, with Nutanix leading the pack. The time to act is now. Enterprises that proactively navigate this transition will mitigate the uncertainties of VMware's new ownership and position themselves for long-term success. The primary job of any IT organization, after all, is minimizing risk while providing the infrastructure for digital transformation.

Februar 2025 /PRNewswire/ -- Polyplastics Co., Ltd., ein weltweit führender Anbieter von technischen Kunststoffen, hat Pläne angekündigt, bis Dezember 2025 eine zu 40 % glasfaserverstärkte Qualität von DURAFIDE (R) rG-PPS als Teil seines mechanischen Recyclinggeschäfts auf den Markt zu bringen. Das Unternehmen wird qualitativ hochwertige, optimale Rezepturen entwickeln, die dazu beitragen werden, die 100-prozentige Kreislauffähigkeit von technischen Kunststoffen zu erreichen, indem sie die Anwendungsmöglichkeiten von mechanisch rezyklierten Materialien erweitern.

Der PPS-Abfall wird als Rohstoff für die Herstellung von DURAFIDE (R) rG-PPS verwendet, das noch in diesem Jahr auf den Markt kommen soll. In den ersten Prozessen werden strenge Abnahmekontrollen durchgeführt und Metall entfernt. In nachfolgenden Prozessen werden Recyclingmaterialien und einige neue Materialien neu formuliert, um die Zielspezifikationen zu erfüllen. Für die Materialien gelten die gleichen Qualitätsstandards wie für neue Materialien. Die offene PIR-Regelung wird den Kunden helfen, Abfälle zu reduzieren und effektiv zu nutzen und auch die Kohlenstoffemissionen ihrer Produkte deutlich zu verringern. Vorerst wird das Rohmaterial der Kunden aus bestimmten Typen von DURAFIDE (R) glasverstärktem PPS bestehen.

Das Unternehmen wird ein System einrichten, um diese Sorte und die zu 40 % glasfaserverstärkte Sorte an Kunden in Japan zu liefern. Das Geschäft mit der erneuten Zusammenstellung und die Einrichtung des offenen PIR-Systems erfordern Anwendungen sowie die Einrichtung von Sammelrouten. Das Unternehmen strebt die Zusammenarbeit mit seinen Kunden sowie mit Unternehmen der Recycling- und Industrieabfallbehandlung an.

He’s long been considered the likely successor to Luke Sayers.,"By [Jake Niall](/by/jake-niall-hved4) Rob Priestley has been appointed Carlton’s new president, succeeding former PwC boss Luke Sayers. Priestley is presently one of the club’s vice presidents and is the current chairman of financial services firm J.P. Morgan Australia and New Zealand. He had long been seen as a successor to Sayers. His co-vice president Patty Kinnersly chose not to contest the position. The Blues will ratify the composition of their board at their upcoming annual general meeting this month. Priestley, who is based in Sydney, attends most games and is regularly around the club. “From a very young age, watching the reserves and seniors with my grandfather, father, and brothers on the city-side wing of our home at IKON Park, Carlton has always given me a strong sense of belonging – no doubt like it has for so many of you,” Priestley said in a statement on the club website. “It is a privilege to receive this opportunity and not for a second will I take it for granted. “I can see the united culture our club is building, which is critical to our overarching goal of consistently contending and ultimately winning AFL and AFLW premierships. “I very much look forward to playing my part, working collectively with our entire Carlton community as we strive to establish our club as an industry leader on a stable and consistent basis. “Our football club does not belong to any one individual, be it the board, the players, coaches, coteries, or administrators – it is the collective, with everybody playing their part, that will make Carlton great on a sustainable basis. “We are united, inclusive and values-led, and I firmly believe the strength of our community, unified by a Stronger Together mindset and a common goal, is how we reach the level we aspire to.” More to come Keep up to date with the best AFL coverage in the country.

79219108,Bengals QB Joe Burrow wins NFL Comeback Player of Year for second time in career,Joe Burrow won the NFL Comeback Player of the Year award for the second time in his career after leading the league in passing yards and touchdowns.,"For the second time in his NFL career, Joe Burrow has capped his return from a season-ending injury by claiming one of the league's top honors. The Cincinnati Bengals quarterback won the NFL Comeback Player of the Year award on Thursday at NFL Honors. He is only the second player to ever win the award twice after Chad Pennington did so with the New York Jets in 2006 and Miami Dolphins in 2008. Burrow beat out Minnesota Vikings quarterback Sam Darnold as well as Los Angeles Chargers running back J.K. Dobbins, New England Patriots cornerback Christian Gonzalez and Buffalo Bills safety Damar Hamlin. Burrow led the NFL in passing yards (4,918) and passing touchdowns (43) this season after missing the final seven games of the 2023 campaign with a torn ligament in his wrist. He became the third quarterback to have at least 4,500 passing yards, 40 passing touchdowns and fewer than 10 interceptions, joining Tom Brady in 2007 and Aaron Rodgers in 2011. Despite mounting a late push for the playoffs by ending the season on a five-game win streak, Cincinnati fell short of the postseason for the second consecutive year when it didn't land the help it needed from other teams to clinch a wild-card berth. He was also a finalist for the NFL's Most Valuable Player and Offensive Player of the Year, with Bengals teammate Ja'Marr Chase joining him in the latter category. Burrow also won the award in 2021 after his rookie season was cut short by a knee injury that included multiple torn ligaments. Burrow, who was also a finalist for MVP and Offensive Player of the Year, told USA TODAY Sports earlier Thursday he believes he has a good of a case as anyone for the former award. ""I don’t think anybody was playing any better than I was this year,"" Burrow said. ""I doubt I win the award, but I think I was playing my best ball.""",usatoday.com,https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/nfl/bengals/2025/02/06/joe-burrow-wins-nfl-comeback-player-year-award-results-voting/78187139007/,[],[],2025-02-06,2025-02-06,0,0,80,148,1830

79219117,"Case Against Dadasaheb Phalke International Film Festival Organisers For ""Fraud""",The Mumbai Police have charged the organizers of the Dadasaheb Phalke International Film Festival with allegedly claiming the Centre's support to hold the event and deceiving various state governments.,"The Mumbai Police have registered a case against organisers of the Dadasaheb Phalke International Film Festival (DPIFF) for allegedly claiming the Centre's support to hold the event and deceiving various state governments and entities like Punjab National Bank, Cinepolis and PVR Inox for sponsorship. The organisers, including DPIFF founder and Managing Director Anil Mishra, also allegedly sold awards in the name of Dadasaheb Phalke - known as the ""Father of Indian Cinema"" - to several actors, including those whose films were commercially unsuccessful, police sources said. The accused also cited the participation of prominent Bollywood actors and reportedly took Rs 2.5 lakh for a pass (that would permit two people) for the event that is scheduled to be held at Taj Lands End in the upscale Bandra area of Mumbai on February 19 and 20. The DPIFF is the country's only independent global film fest and the most prestigious cinematic celebration that honours the legacy of Dadasaheb Phalke, according to information available on its website. To be sure, the awards distributed in the event are different from the one given by the President of India as part of the National Film Awards. There was no immediate comment from the organisers of the DPIFF till the time of filing this report. The police sources said a First Information Report (FIR) against Mr Mishra - a former member of the Central Board of Film Certification, his wife Parvati Mishra and their son Abhishek Mishra, among others, was registered for falsely claiming the support of prominent political leaders like Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Union Home Minister Amit Shah to make the event appear credible. The organisers also claimed that the event seeks to promote the ""Incredible India"" campaign, an international tourism campaign launched by the Ministry of Tourism in 2002 to portray India as a tourist destination. Besides, the organisers tried to portray the event as part of the ""Dadasaheb Phalke Lifetime Achievement Award"" that is presented by the President of India. Mr Anil Mishra, the sources said, used letters of good wishes purportedly written by Prime Minister Modi, Mr Shah, Tourism Minister Dharmendra Pradhan and former Prime Minister Manmohan Singh to promote the event. The accused allegedly collected sponsorship from government and semi-government institutions. He collected money from the tourism department of the states of Uttar Pradesh, Rajasthan, Gujarat, Punjab and Maharashtra, Punjab National Bank, the State Bank of India and Life Insurance Corporation. The organisers also targeted Haldirams, Acer, Cinepolis, PVR Inox and Senco among others. Mr Mishra also collected money from actors, whose films were commercially unsuccessful, in exchange for an award, the sources said. Moreover, the company - International Tourism Festival Private Limited - under whose name he obtained the sponsorship has been shut down, the sources added. The case was filed on the basis of a complaint by Sameer Dixit, who is the Maharashtra president of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)'s Chitrapat Kamgar Aghadi that claims to support artists, technicians and workers of the film, television and digital industry. ""When we tried to dig up information on the film festival, we learnt that the organisers tried to make the event appear as though it was government-supported. They also used the Prime Minister's Office and names of ministers as a reference to promote the event and misguide the people. They also said the festival seeks to promote the 'Incredible India' tourism campaign. They took sponsorship from public sector units like Punjab Tourism and Uttarakhand Tourism and Punjab National Bank. We have gathered all the evidence and given them to the police,"" Mr Dixit said. The organisers have been charged under sections 318 (4) - deals with cheating and fraud - and 319 (2) - punishment for the crime - of the Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita and a probe is underway, the police sources said.

What is this about: On November 25, 2024, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) issued a press release entitled “SEC Charges Ken Leech, Former Co-Chief Investment Officer of Western Asset Management Co., with Fraud.” This press release stated that Leech had been charged with fraud “for engaging in a multi-year scheme to allocate favorable trades to certain portfolios, while allocating unfavorable trades to other portfolios, a practice known as cherry-picking.” Why Rosen Law: We encourage investors to select qualified counsel with a track record of success in leadership roles. Often, firms issuing notices do not have comparable experience, resources, or any meaningful peer recognition. Many of these firms do not actually litigate securities class actions. Be wise in selecting counsel. The Rosen Law Firm represents investors throughout the globe, concentrating its practice in securities class actions and shareholder derivative litigation. Rosen Law Firm achieved the largest ever securities class action settlement against a Chinese Company at the time. Rosen Law Firm was Ranked No. 1 by ISS Securities Class Action Services for number of securities class action settlements in 2017. The firm has been ranked in the top 4 each year since 2013 and has recovered hundreds of millions of dollars for investors. In 2019 alone the firm secured over $438 million for investors.

Enjoy! Today’s Wordle Etymology The word ""swath"" comes from the Old English ""swæth"" or ""swathu,"" meaning ""track, trace, footprint, or swath cut by a scythe."" It is related to the Proto-Germanic ""swathō"" (track, footprint) and is linked to the verb ""swithan"" (to sweep, smooth). Over time, the meaning narrowed to refer specifically to the area cut by a scythe or mower, and later, it evolved into a more figurative sense of a broad strip or expanse.

79219103,Omega Healthcare Investors (OHI) Q4 2024 Earnings Call Transcript,"OHI earnings call for the period ending December 31, 2024.","Omega Healthcare Investors ([OHI](/quote/nyse/ohi/) -0.68%) Q4 2024 Earnings Call Feb 06, 2025, 10:00 a.m. ET Contents: - Prepared Remarks - Questions and Answers - Call Participants Prepared Remarks: Operator Thank you for standing by. My name is Kate, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Omega Healthcare Investors fourth quarter earnings conference call. [Operator instructions] I would now like to turn the call over to Michele Reber. Please go ahead. Michele Reber -- Senior Director, Asset Management Thank you, and good morning. With me today is Omega's CEO, Taylor Pickett, president, Matthew Gourmand, CFO, Bob Stephenson, CIO, Vikas Gupta, and Megan Krull, senior vice president of operations. Comments made during this conference call that are not historical facts may be forward-looking statements such as statements regarding our financial projections, potential transactions, operator prospects and outlook generally. Factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements are detailed in the company's filings with the SEC. During the call today, we will refer to some GAAP financial measures, such as NAREIT FFO, adjusted FFO, FAD and EBITDA. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to the most comparable measure under generally accepted accounting principles are available in the quarterly supplement. In addition, certain operator coverage and financial information that we discuss is based on data provided by our operators that has not been independently verified by Omega. I will now turn the call over to Taylor. Taylor C. Pickett -- Chief Executive Officer Thanks, Michele. Good morning, and thank you for joining our fourth quarter 2024 earnings conference call. Today, I will discuss our fourth quarter financial results, management changes and certain key operating trends. Fourth quarter FAD, funds available for distribution of $0.70 per share reflects continued revenue and EBITDA growth, which has allowed us to reduce leverage to below 4.0x debt-to-EBITDA while continuing to deliver FAD growth in 2024. Our 2025 AFFO guidance is $2.90 per share to $2.98 per share which reflects the first quarter 2025 dilutive impact of our significant fourth quarter share issuances, offset by escalators and other opportunities throughout 2025. We recently announced management changes with Matthew Gourmand named president, and Vikas Gupta, named chief investment officer. I am extremely confident in their ability to lead our exceptional team in the upcoming years. I would also like to thank Dan Booth. I had the opportunity to work with Dan for over 30 years, 23 years here at Omega. Dan's many contributions to Omega are an important driver of Omega's outperformance of not only other healthcare REITs, but all REITs over the last 23 years. Lastly in 2024, the team did a great job staying disciplined while forcing and closing 36 transactions, deploying approximately $1.1 billion in capital. The 2025 acquisition pipeline remains active. I will now turn the call over to Bob. Robert O. Stephenson -- Chief Financial Officer Thanks, Taylor, and good morning. Turning to our financials for the fourth quarter. Revenue for the fourth quarter was $279 million compared to $239 million for the fourth quarter of 2023. The year-over-year increase is primarily the result of the timing and impact of revenue from new investments completed throughout 2024, operator restructurings and transitions, partially offset by asset sales completed during that same time period. Our NAREIT FFO for the fourth quarter was $196 million or $0.68 per share as compared to $129 million or $0.50 per share for the fourth quarter of 2023. Our adjusted FFO was $214 million or $0.74 per share for the quarter and our FAD was $202 million or $0.70 per share and both exclude several items outlined in our NAREIT FFO, adjusted FFO and FAD reconciliations to net income found in our earnings release, as well as our fourth quarter financial supplemental posted to our website. Our Q4 FAD was just under $0.005 greater than our Q3 FAD, which is impressive. If you remember, in Q3, we issued 14 million shares for $530 million in gross proceeds at an average price of $37.32 per share. These 14 million shares issued at the end of the third quarter were not fully included within the weighted average third quarter share count. As outlined in our earnings press release, during the fourth quarter, we completed $340 million of new investments and funded the investments through the issuance of an additional 11 million shares of equity for gross proceeds totaling $438 million at an average price of $40.19 per share. Our balance sheet remained strong at year-end as we ended the year with over $500 million in cash that was used to repay a $400 million bond on January 15, 2025. We ended the month of January with over $240 million in cash, the full borrowing capacity of our $1.45 billion credit facility, and approximately $820 million available under our ATM program all ready to deploy as needed in new investments. As long as our equity currency remains favorable, we will continue to prefund investments by issuing equity. At December 31, 95% of our $4.9 billion in debt was at fixed rates. And our fixed charge coverage ratio was 4.7 times and our net funded debt to annualized adjusted normalized EBITDA was 3.96 times, which is the lowest our leverage has been in 10 years. We still have a target leverage range between four to five times with the sweet spot being between 4.5 to 4.75 times. As we continue to fund acquisitions accretively with equity, we position ourselves for outsized AFFO growth once we decided to reenter the bond market. As Taylor mentioned, we provided our full year adjusted FFO guidance of a range between $2.90 to $2.98 per share. A few of the key 2025 guidance assumptions are, we're assuming no change in our revenue related to operators on an accrual basis of revenue recognition. As a note, over 75% of our operators are currently on a straight-line basis of accounting, which meets any growth in revenue through annual escalators will not yield further growth in adjusted FFO but growth in cash flow. We're assuming Maplewood's ability to pay contractual rent continues to improve. Of the $260 million in mortgages and other real estate-backed investments contractually maturing in 2025, $124 million will convert from loans to fee simple real estate and $28 million will be repaid throughout 2025. We are assuming the balance of the loans will be extended beyond 2025. We're assuming $56 million in asset sales related to assets classified as held for sale, which we recorded $1.9 million of revenue in the fourth quarter. We've included the impact of new investments completed as of February 5. We project our quarterly G&A expense to run between $12 million to $14 million in 2025 with the first quarter typically being the highest quarter. We assume we will repay our $230 million of secured debt in November 2025. We assume no material changes in market interest rates as they relate to either interest earned on balance sheet cash or interest expense charge on credit facility borrowings. Finally, consistent with how we ended 2024, we assume we will position ourselves with enough cash on the balance sheet by the end of 2025 to repay our January 2026, $600 million bond maturity. As a reminder, to the extent our equity currency remains favorable, and we continue to prefund investments, or prepare for debt maturities for every 4 million shares issued, assuming shares are issued at prices consistent with 2024 or quarterly adjusted FFO is negatively impacted by slightly less than $0.01 per share, while our leverage improves or it was reduced by approximately 0.15x until the cash is put back to work in new investments. Our 2025 adjusted FFO guidance does not include any additional investments or asset sales, as well as any additional capital transactions other than what I just mentioned or what was included in the earnings release. I will now turn the call over to Vikas. Vikas Gupta -- Chief Investment Officer Thank you, Bob, and good morning, everyone. Today, we'll be discussing the most recent performance trends for Omega's operating portfolio and Omega's investment activity in 2024 and share insight into Omega's piping for 2025. Turning to portfolio performance. Trailing 12-month operator EBITDAR coverage for our core portfolio as of September 30, 2024, increased to 1.5 times versus 1.49 times for the trailing 12-month period ended June 30, 2024. We want to highlight that the most recent quarter's performance is a continuation of trailing 12-month coverage improvement across our portfolio over the past year. These ongoing improvements were reflective of the strength and expertise of Omega's operating partners, the resolution or nearly all of Omega's portfolio restructurings over recent years, and the disciplined allocation of new investment capital over the past year. Despite continued pressures from suboptimal labor and reimbursement levels in select markets, the industry landscape continues to improve as a result of the growing aging population and our operators' ability to serve an increasingly complex resident population. However, with occupancy now approaching pre-COVID levels, we would expect any future coverage increases to be more modest. As of today, the only major operator, Omega is engaged in restructuring activity with is Levi. Levi continues to work toward exiting bankruptcy in the second quarter of 2025 but the effective date of such exit is conditioned upon the rulings on pending motions before the bankruptcy court. In the interim, Omega expects to continue to receive full contractual rent of $3.1 million per month or $37.5 million per annum. Turning to new investments. As Taylor previously mentioned, Omega's transaction pipeline in 2024 was very strong with over $1.1 billion in new investments. These transactions varied in size and nature and demonstrate Omega's ability to adapt to the evolving investment landscape in the long-term care industry. In 2004, we continue to support the growth of our existing and new operators by focusing on strong credit-backed real estate investments and real estate loans with exceptional returns that often provide Omega with the ultimate opportunity for real estate ownership. Specifically, of the approximately $359 million or 31% of Omega's new investments in 2024 that were real estate loans, over $124 million or one-third of those loans provide Omega with the opportunity to acquire the underlying real estate upon maturity with long-term triple net lease structures already negotiated. The balance of new real estate loans made in 2024 supported existing operator relationships or facilitated our borrowers acquisitions of distressed assets at prices well below replacement costs. Also, the UK was a large driver of our 2024 new investments, totaling over $782 million or 68% of our total new investments. We have been investing in the UK for over a decade now and have accumulated a strong bench of operators and other relationships there, which lead us to highly accretive investment opportunities. Looking at the fourth quarter of 2024, Omega completed a total of $363 million in new investments, inclusive of $23 million in capex. The new investments include $179 million in real estate acquisitions across four transactions which have an average initial annual cash yield of 9.9% and $162 million real estate loans which have a weighted average interest rate of 10.9%. A large portion of these new real estate loans, $101 million or 62% provide Omega with the opportunity to acquire the underlying real estate upon maturity. Subsequent to the fourth quarter of 2024, Omega closed on $26 million in new investments, excluding capex. These investments include a $10.6 million acquisition of two facilities with an initial cash yield of 9.9% via a new lease with a new operator and a $15.4 million mortgage to an existing operator for two facilities with an 11% interest rate. Turning to the pipeline. Omega's pipeline and transaction outlook for 2025 continues to be quite healthy. We continue to see marketed opportunities both in the US and the UK, while also benefiting from off-market opportunities that our existing operating partners and other relationships bring us. Based on the current lending environment, it is our expectation that we will continue to receive inquiries for real estate loans while we continue to evaluate and engage in select loan opportunities, primarily for existing operator relationships, our priority will always be to allocate capital toward accretive owned real estate deals to grow our balance sheet. So I'll now turn the call over to Megan. Megan Krull -- Senior Vice President, Operations Thanks, Vikas, and good morning, everyone. As with the start of any new administration, there are a lot of unknowns before us. And while it is too soon to tell what lies ahead, there are many reasons to feel secure about where we currently stand. As Vikas mentioned, coverages are the strongest they've been in years, which is reflective of the continuing recovery from the pandemic. The industry still grapples with the overhang of many issues, most notably staffing shortages, but for now, things appear relatively stable. While the Trump agenda specifically calls entitlement reform into the forefront of potential policy changes, we also know that President Trump supported this industry with government aid when it was the most critical during COVID. We hope that understanding of the importance of this industry hasn't been lost. We continue to monitor the various efforts against the staffing mandate. As I noted last quarter, a motion for summary judgment was filed in the federal court case in the state of Texas brought by certain industry associations among others, which we still hear could be decided as early as the end of this quarter or early next quarter. While the 20 attorneys general who filed suit against the mandate in Federal Court in Iowa lost their plea for preliminary injunction, their case continues moving forward as well. Irrespective of the court cases, a legislative repeal is still very much a possibility given that the reversal of the rule would stand to save the federal government $22 billion over 10 years according to the Congressional Budget Office. We are still very hopeful that the rule will ultimately be overturned, and we hope that any future rule-making surrounding reimbursement or regulation is done so with an even hand and an understanding of what is truly at stake. I will now open the call up for questions. Questions & Answers: Operator [Operator instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Jonathan Hughes with Raymond James. Please go ahead. Jonathan Hughes -- Analyst Hi, good morning. Thanks for the prepared remarks and commentary, and congrats to Matthew and Vikas on their new roles and Dan on a great career. Vikas, I was hoping you could share some more details of what the investment pipeline looks like today in terms of dollar size yields and then fee simple acquisitions versus loans. Vikas Gupta -- Chief Investment Officer Yes. Thanks, Jonathan. So the pipeline, as I said in my prepared remarks, looks strong. It's a little bit more heavily weighted right now in the UK, but that can change as things progress. And we're mostly looking at small midsized deals at this time. A bit more real estate focused, which we're just going to continue to pursue more than loans at this time. But again, all of that can change as things play out. Jonathan Hughes -- Analyst OK. And I think I heard in maybe Bob's prepared remarks, there are some loans that are converting to fee simple ownership this year. Was that always the plan for those? Or were those operators hopeful to refi and due to the challenging lending environment, this is kind of the option that they're locked with? Vikas Gupta -- Chief Investment Officer Yes, Jonathan, this is Vikas again. So we did a few loans last year knowing that they would convert to leases. And that was done primarily due to regulatory timing in the UK It takes a long time to get those approvals in the UK So we structure loans so our operators, borrowers could get the deals done. And then,, the terms are short, they're all within this year, they'll convert the leases -- real estate leases. Operator Your next question comes from the line of Michael Griffin with Citi. Please go ahead. Michael Griffin -- Citi -- Analyst Appreciate the color kind of on the regulatory front and the potential implications of the new administration. Just wondering if you could give any insight into kind of the labor environment and demand there that your operators are seeing? And is there any worry that potential immigration reform could impact the labor pool and maybe further pressure wages? Megan Krull -- Senior Vice President, Operations Yes. I mean, look, the labor environment is still tough, especially in the more rural areas and that is probably going to be -- continue to be tough for a long time unless something changes. And so, the immigration policy is definitely going to play into that to the extent that we can legally bring in immigrants to supplement the nursing force that helps and we'll just have to wait to see how that all progresses, but we haven't seen any impact from the immigration policies at this time. Michael Griffin -- Citi -- Analyst That's helpful. And then, maybe a question for Vikas just getting back to the acquisition pipeline and the opportunity set. There's been some news over the past couple of months just around SNF operators and maybe financial and tenant health is coming more into the focus. I'm curious if you've seen more scrutiny on underwriting prospective deals, whether it's from a rent coverage perspective, just given maybe there could be some potential issues or worries around operator health. Again, it seems like it's more idiosyncratic to certain tenants to certain operators. But have you seen it change in kind of underwriting from that perspective? Vikas Gupta -- Chief Investment Officer No, we really haven't. We continue to underwrite where we have historically credit-based deals with strong operators and I think I agree with your point. It is more idiosyncratic. Operator Your next question comes from the line of John Kilichowski with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead. John Kilichowski -- Analyst Thank you. Maybe I'll just follow up very quickly on one more on the pipeline. Maybe could you talk more about the competitive landscape today and your expectation around going in yields? Vikas Gupta -- Chief Investment Officer Yes. I mean, we aren't seeing a big change in competitive environment. I mean there are family offices, private investors, both in the US and the UK. We're seeing less competition in the UK right now due to lack of capital there. But otherwise, we're not seeing a big change in competition. As for yields, we're staying where we've always stayed, close to 10%, and we're able to deploy capital there. John Kilichowski -- Analyst Understood. And then, maybe one for Bob here. Just on balance sheet fortification. Your leverage is at four times long-term target of four to five times. So not a pressing need to deleverage here. But according to the guide, there's going to be some material equity issuance here to delever in the back half or '26 maturity. One, could you kind of give us the guide for what that number is, obviously, ex any acquisition activity and then maybe more your thoughts about the decision to firm up the balance sheet at the expense of maybe some incremental dilution here? And what are you looking at? Is that the relative spread of your AFFO yield to the current cost of 10-year paper versus what it's been historically? Robert O. Stephenson -- Chief Financial Officer That's a correct statement, what you just said. So they hit a couple of -- there were a couple of questions in there. So we're going to treat the guidance similar to what we did in '24, be prepared to handle that debt maturity coming due in '26, similar to what we did for the one we just paid off. Given our cost of equity right now, we're taking advantage that we'll be opportunistic. The guidance does not have future acquisitions in. But in order to get the $600 million, you need to issue the equity there. But we will be opportunistic if the bond market turns around and we can issue bonds, we'll do that. I mean we've always been in a position to readily hit either the equity or bond market. Operator Your next question comes from the line of Juan Sanabria with BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead. Juan C. Sanabria -- Analyst Hi, Good morning. Just following up there on that same line of questioning. What share count, I guess, is assumed or how much equity is assumed to raise as part of guidance to pay maturing loans booked this year and then to prep for the '26 Jan maturity you referenced? Robert O. Stephenson -- Chief Financial Officer We give out the exact share count on, but it's really going to be -- to get to the $600 million, the share count is going to be driven by the price and the timing that I issue that equity to get to $600 million. So the price is high, less equity needed that's outside of the guidance and if the price goes down from where we are today or historically, what we had in the third and fourth quarter and it still accretive to do it that way, we fund it, and we'll be at the lower end of the guidance. Juan C. Sanabria -- Analyst OK. And you're assuming other remaining 25 debt maturities are also repaid with cash/equity. Is that correct, just to make sure? Robert O. Stephenson -- Chief Financial Officer That's correct. Yes. Operator Your next question comes from the line of Nick Yulico with Scotiabank. Please go ahead. Nicholas Yulico -- Analyst Couple of questions just on Maplewood and then the Guardian transition assets. If you could just give us a feel for kind of where you're at in terms of getting back to sort of a maximum rent on those operators. And I guess, specifically on Maplewood, as we think about the Second Avenue asset, how that maybe an update on how that occupancy is trending and how important that is to get back to the full Maplewood rent? Vikas Gupta -- Chief Investment Officer Yes. Nick, this is Vikas here. So on Maplewood, our total portfolio's occupancy is now at 91%. That includes Second Avenue. And Second Avenue itself is at 85%. So things are looking good there for our core portfolio with Maplewood. They paid strong rent in January, and we feel like that rent is sustainable, if not, will go up as occupancy increases in the second half so overall we feel very good about Maplewood at the moment. For Guardian, that transition happened last year to a new operator, they hit their high threshold of rent, and we will just see what happens in the future. But right now, everything is going as planned. Nicholas Yulico -- Analyst OK. And then, just to be clear, the guidance for the year assumes that it's just both those operators pay existing rent that they're paying that they're not paying a higher level? Robert O. Stephenson -- Chief Financial Officer That is correct. If Maplewood is at the higher level, that's one component that takes us to our higher end of our guidance. Operator Your next question comes from the line of Farrell Granath with Bank of America. Please go ahead. Farrell Granath -- Analyst I wanted to touch on the EBITDAR coverage. I know that you made the comment that the increases may be a little bit more modest going forward. But can you go through a little bit of the moving pieces and maybe how that's looking if it wasn't a trailing four quarters, specifically one tying in, I also see the less than 1x coverage had a larger ding on a small rent percentage? Megan Krull -- Senior Vice President, Operations Yes. I mean in terms of that one operator under one times, that's a one facility deal that we acquired as part of a larger transaction. It's not a typical asset cost for us. It's not a SNF. It's not an ALF. It's a specialty hospital, and they have very volatile earnings so they bounce all around. So that I don't think is indicative of anything that you would expect to see in the rest of the portfolio. We continue to see a good performance from the rest of our portfolio and continuing to see everything moderate and be strong. Farrell Granath -- Analyst Great. And also on that mix, I also saw the -- there's a slight uptick in the private insurers kind of a larger one than I've seen in the last couple of quarters. I was curious what was driving that? Are you seeing the payer mix shifting more toward private? Megan Krull -- Senior Vice President, Operations It's just highly dependent on the deals that we do. So as we do more UK deals that private pay is going to come up a bit. Operator Your next question comes from the line of Michael Carroll with RBC Capital Markets. Michael Carroll -- Analyst I wanted to circle back to Maplewood. I mean how is Maplewood positioned today? I mean, are they better positioned to really ramp up their EBITDAR now versus the beginning of 2024. I mean if you look at the 2024 rent, I think the quarterly rent increased by roughly $1 million between 1Q and 4Q '24. I mean should we expect a similar ramp up in 2025? Or given that the development in New York's occupancy is improving that it could be higher than that? Vikas Gupta -- Chief Investment Officer Yes. This is Vikas. I mean we see things getting better this year. Occupancy at Second Avenue now is at 85%. The team feels in Maplewood, that we'll get to above 90% later this year. So things are in the right direction. I mean we just have to see how this plays out over the next few months. But I mean, it will still take one to two years to stabilize the entire relationship. Michael Carroll -- Analyst OK. And then, circle back, I think you've probably touched on this a little bit related to the investment pipeline. But are any buyers or sellers acting differently today, specifically for the US properties, just given the volatility we've seen in interest rates and the political environment discussing potential, I guess, Medicaid restructuring. Have people slowed down their investment activity, as sellers been more aggressive trying to get out. Have you seen anything like that occurring? Vikas Gupta -- Chief Investment Officer No, we've not seen any dramatic changes today. As Megan said, I think we're all just waiting to see what plays out, if anything, but at the current time, we're underwriting, we think our peers are underwriting the same way they always have. So no material changes at this time. Operator Your next question comes from the line of Alec Feygin with Baird. Alec Feygin -- Robert W. Baird and Company -- Analyst So going to the UK exposure, I think it's about a little over 14%. What are you comfortable getting that up to? Matthew Gourmand -- President Alex, it's Matthew here. I don't think we have a target in mind. I think we look at each deal on its own merits. We think that the UK is a highly compelling investment opportunity at this point in time. We have very similar dynamics as you have in the US SNF market in terms of very limited new supply, burgeoning growth opportunity in terms of an aging baby boomer demographic. And we've developed a really good platform of operators there that are keen to grow and have the financial and operational capability to do so. So I think we will continue to grow that portfolio, obviously, as it grows. We evaluate it in the mix of everything. But I don't think we have a threshold over which we would want to go. I think it's just going to be based on what opportunities we see in the US and UK markets. Alec Feygin -- Robert W. Baird and Company -- Analyst And does Omega have a plan to maybe hedge the UK cash flows as it grows? Matthew Gourmand -- President It's definitely something we're talking about internally. Yes, given where the dollar has gone against the pound right now, you feel like you might be bottom ticking the market a little bit. So I think it's something that we will continue to look at. But as of today, we haven't got any definitive decisions around that. Operator Your next question comes from the line of Emily Meckler with Green Street. Please go ahead. Emily Meckler -- Green Street Advisors -- Analyst Have the increased employment taxes and increased minimum wage in the UK had a noticeable impact on coverage level for your UK portfolio? And does this kind of change your underwriting criteria moving forward there? Vikas Gupta -- Chief Investment Officer This is Vikas. No, we've seen no dramatic changes due to those changes in the UK at this time. Emily Meckler -- Green Street Advisors -- Analyst OK. Great. And then, maybe one for Megan. Could you give us a sense for what percentage of workers in skilled nursing facilities are for inborn? Megan Krull -- Senior Vice President, Operations I do not have that information. I'm not sure. I do know that obviously, some of the legal immigration that's been happening over the last few years, some of our operators have brought folks in, but we don't know the percentages. Operator Your next question comes from the line of Jonathan Hughes with Raymond James. Jonathan Hughes -- Analyst Bob, I was hoping you could give us some details on FAD or cash earnings expectations. Should that gap between AFFO and FAD, similar to last year, it's narrowed by about half over the past, call it, pre-COVID versus today. I know that's because some operators should move from cash to accrual, but just any color there would be great. Robert O. Stephenson -- Chief Financial Officer Yes, you're right. We don't give FAD guidance, but big picture, that relationship will be pretty similar to Q4. I think there's two points to remember open FAD. I already stated that 76% of our revenues on a straight-line basis. So less escalators hit, they don't impact AFFO, but they do impact FAD. So that's 23% of that we'll have some closing of the gap there. And then, just remember with the Maplewood DC asset, that capped interest goes away as revenue will be recording revenue on those assets. Operator Your next question comes from the line of Vikram Malhotra with Mizuho. Vikram Malhotra -- Analyst I guess just first, back on the UK, could you just talk about how much of the push in the UK kind of in '25, '26, maybe perhaps a little bit of a hedge against changes and potential changes in Medicaid or other changes here. And then, in the UK itself, what about raising debt in the UK also versus the US? Matthew Gourmand -- President Sure. Thanks, Vikram. It's Matthew again. So on the first question, I don't think it's really hedge effort on our part. I think it really is just that we're seeing a lot of opportunities in the UK right now to transact with quality operators. And so, we're taking advantage of that market side. I feel like our US Medicaid -- how we feel about the US Medicaid market hasn't fundamentally changed over the last 12 months. And certainly, even with the new administration, I think that Medicaid will continue to be a necessary part of the funding environment. If you look at a lot of the transactions we were doing early in the year in 2024 where we really didn't know what the administration would look like. So it's really just a reflection of the fact that we're seeing good opportunities over there. In terms of the debt side of things, we continue to look at the best way to fund both from a hedging standpoint and from an interest rate standpoint. Candidly, the numbers that were often quoted initially in terms of the debt interest rates we could get are not what we're actually seeing when we look to potentially execute on stuff over there. So as a result, we've continued to fund any debt in the US, again, we'll keep looking at that. Should the opportunity exist to have a favorable interest rate in the UK, we will obviously look to execute. Vikram Malhotra -- Analyst Got it. And then, just perhaps going back to potential regulation, I mean, do you have thoughts or just based on, I guess, if you've had concessions with folks in D.C., kind of what route could be minimum staffing take legislatively versus legal? And then any thought on what's been proposed by Republican party in terms of whether it's SNAP changes or adjustments to like including quality measures or even block grants. Just maybe give us a bigger picture, I know there's a lot of -- there's a lot being thrown out there. We don't know what's going to happen, but just specifically on those kind of what's your view on those changes? Megan Krull -- Senior Vice President, Operations I mean, look, on the staffing mandate, we think the Chevron Doctrine being gone away is going to help us with the legal case. And certainly, at the legal case, depending on how that society, we think legislatively, this is probably going to go away given the price tag on it and the effort by the Republican party to cut costs. So we're very hopeful on the stopping mandate side as is ACA. In terms of what else could happen, it's really too soon to tell what exactly would go on and what would be passed congressionally. But if you think about block grants, I mean there's been conversations about block grants for a long, long time. ACA would very much so push for some sort of per capita cap so that if enrollment increases, the funding increases as well. And they would look for some sort of inflationary increases on the long-term care side plus some factor above that. So ACA's very involved in all of that in the lobbying efforts. So we feel very good about what they would be able to accomplish. But again, too soon to tell. But again, as I mentioned, we feel pretty good about where our coverages are. We feel good about the fact that we have a president who was very supportive of this industry during COVID. He really stepped up big time for us and really recognize that this industry is too important to fail. So we hope that, that will continue and that understanding will continue and nothing draconian will happen. And then, when we talk about where the federal spending is. If you think about total Medicaid spending, over 25% of the Medicaid, the federal portion of Medicaid spending is spent on Medicaid expansion, which is what came about via the Affordable Care Act. And so, that covers non-elderly adults that do not have children. So that's over 25% of that spend. And that is -- that constitutes 90% of the federal government money is going toward Medicaid expansion as opposed to 60% going toward the rest of Medicaid. So we really view that Medicaid expansion as being the low-hanging fruit. That's probably the first pass. It doesn't mean that the rest of Medicaid is in semi at risk, but we feel pretty good about the position that we're in. Operator Your next question comes from the line of Juan Sanabria with BMO Capital Markets. Juan C. Sanabria -- Analyst Just going back to the deals that you've done both last year and historically, I guess what should we assume is baked and likely to convert in '25. And how should we think about the delta between the rate that you're getting as a lender versus what you get for -- as you convert it to traditional fee simple? Vikas Gupta -- Chief Investment Officer Yes. Well, this is Vikas. As I said in my prepared comments, we have $124 million that we plan to convert this year, and it is basically the same rate. So I don't think there's any pickup there to the model. But we plan for about $124 million all to convert this year. Juan C. Sanabria -- Analyst OK. And then, just last question. Anything on the loans or rents that are maturing that we should be factoring in the model whether rent increase, stable rents or cuts or anybody that you're looking to retenant as part of maturities? Robert O. Stephenson -- Chief Financial Officer Well, the $28 million is being repaid, that cash will just sit on the balance sheet earnings from interest. And then, the other ones as they get pushed, there's no change in the guidance there. It's at the same rate. Operator Your next question comes from the line of Nick Yulico with Scotiabank. Nicholas Yulico -- Analyst Just a follow-up, Bob, on the guidance and investments not being in versus the cash on the balance at the end of the year assumed. Is there just a rough feel you can give us in terms of if you do a certain level of acquisitions, say, $500 million, how we should think about the incremental debt equity that would be raised for that? Because it does feel like there's something like pre-funding of capital that's already in your guidance this year, but the investments aren't? Robert O. Stephenson -- Chief Financial Officer You are correct. So the prefunding is the $230 million of secured debt that we're going to pay off in November and getting to $600 million. Remember, we do cash flow from operations. So you got to factor that in and we had the -- a little bit of loan repayment we just talked about. Again, in my stated remarks, that we are going to prefund acquisitions as the pipeline gets closer. It's just not in the guidance because the acquisition is not in the guidance. So you have to take both of those into consideration there. I know that doesn't answer -- Nicholas Yulico -- Analyst Yes. That's helpful. I guess just one follow-up there is on. Is there a way to give us a feel for like how your average cash balance might look through the year because there is some interest income benefit. I'm guessing here in the guidance. Robert O. Stephenson -- Chief Financial Officer Yes, it's hard. Again, that's what gets me to the high and the low end of my range. But as I stated on the call, we had $200 million of cash -- over $200 million in cash at the end of January but we do have a big dividend payment coming up. And so, I would think first quarter will be the lower quarters and this really gets back to what is our price, how quickly we -- based on that price, do we issue equity to build up that $600 million. In reality, as you're building up, you're going to use it for acquisitions. So it's really hard, Nick. I apologize, but it's hard. Nicholas Yulico -- Analyst OK, yeah, thanks for that, Bob. Operator I will turn the call back over to Taylor Pickett for closing remarks. Taylor C. Pickett -- Chief Executive Officer Thanks, everyone, for joining the call today. As usual, the team will be prepared for any follow-up questions you may have. Have a great day.

Please note, this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Tom Gayner, chief executive officer. Please go ahead. Thomas Sinnickson Gayner -- Chief Executive Officer Thank you, Audrey, and good morning. Tom Gayner here. Despite it being past the Larry David cutoff, Happy New Year to all. The new year is a natural time to express gratitude and say thank you. It's a time to look forward, to plan, to set priorities, to do some self-examination, and recommit to important values. It's also time to share our 2024 results with you and to talk about our plan for 2025 and beyond. First, let me start by saying thank you to the special people at the Markel Group. I'm lucky to come to work with the people of the Markel Group every day, where 22,000 beating hearts who join as one to conduct our business with humanity and do things for people, not to people. Working at Markel Group is a team sport. We focus on creating a win, win, win world where customers, associates, and shareholders all win, a world where we grow the pie together. I'm proud of and grateful for our leaders and associates. They embrace our culture and make it real. They seek to improve constantly and to serve our customers and shareholders all day every day. Thank you all for what you do. In 2024, this team of leaders and associates achieved operating income and returns above our targets. In any given year, our results are like those of a crew boat, from Rower 1 down the line to Number 8, including the coxswain. Every year, like every race, is a slightly different story when it comes to how the oars are rowing. In 2024, the public equity portfolio was our boat's stern pair, setting the pace with strong returns. In the middle of the boat for this run, we saw mixed results from our insurance business. Many areas performed well, including international, State National, and much of the U.S. specialty. Underwriting income and reinsurance, as well as some areas within U.S. specialty, were below our expectations. Finally, our ventures businesses continued to generate strong profitability and exceeded our target returns, driven by strong performance in our consumer and building products businesses. Ventures found a strong, steady pace in 2024 from the bow. Together, our rowers produced an outstanding year of returns in 2024, which is part of the beauty of the design. But there's still the opportunity for better operating performance and for every oar to drive to its full potential and in unison with every stroke. Later, we will share more about what we were doing to get there. But first, some context is important. The insurance underperformance has not been a one-year thing. Some of these seeds were sown during a transitional period that began when Markel passed the baton to its next generation of leaders, which began formally in 2016. By 2022, it became clear that the initial structure put in on the front end, which included a co-CEO approach, was causing challenges in terms of focus and accountability. At that time and with that realization, we implemented a series of actions to drive improved performance at the company, including, one, defining the purpose and function of the Markel Group; two, organizing around that purpose, including appointing a sole CEO and making additional key changes in leadership; three, creating a clear decision framework with respect to capital allocation; and four, placing greater emphasis on profitability and returns. The combination of these changes has helped restore greater accountability and focus. Much has already been accomplished from making these changes, in particular within our insurance business. There, we began to address underperforming products through specific portfolio actions, exiting several unprofitable lines, reunderwriting others, and growing in areas of strength. Jeremy will provide an update on these actions shortly. Looking back from where we stand today, we have much to be proud of. Markel is earning good returns. We remain committed to our customers. We see these green shoots in our insurance business from the steps we have taken there. The Markel style continues to guide us. Overall, the Markel Group system is stronger, and much of the groundwork for the road ahead has been laid. But our aspiration is not just to be a good company or even a great company, but to be one of the world's great companies. That means more consistent excellence across all our operations all the time is required. Charting such a course requires continuous self-examination and a never-ending zealous pursuit of excellence. In 2025 and beyond, we will continue to improve the foundation of our business. Yesterday, we announced a board-led review that will include evaluating where we can continue to improve our insurance organization. As part of the review, we will consider ways to simplify our structure, find greater efficiency, optimize our approach to capital allocation, and enhance our disclosures. External consultants and advisors will assist with the review. We look forward to updating our shareholders when that work is completed. Before moving forward, I want to mention that we will not be taking questions about the board-led review at this time and we'll focus on questions relating to our business. Our pursuit of becoming one of the world's great companies in Markel has always come from providing an atmosphere in which people can reach their potential. We want to ensure that our associates are invigorated and empowered. We want to reward the best-performing crew members and hold every crew member in the boat accountable. Your feedback will be incorporated into our work. As the author Ken Blanchard once said, feedback is the breakfast of champions. One theme that emerged from our recent conversations with shareholders is that you see early progress in insurance but also would like more information on what success looks like, path to get there, and signposts to track along the way. In a similar vein, investors also asked for increased clarity with respect to certain aspects of ventures' performance as it doesn't seem to be fully appreciated. We will do better to provide you with this information. Beyond all that I just mentioned, on the capital allocation front, we have been repurchasing more shares over the last two years. In 2022, I believe the trend in our stock price started to significantly diverge from that of Markel Group's intrinsic value. In 2022, we repurchased 291 million of our shares. This was when I began speaking more openly about the business' intrinsic value growth. It's my duty to explain to our shareholders why we're using more of their capital for share repurchases. We repurchased more shares in '23 and '24, totaling 445 million and 573 million, respectively. In '24, our board authorized an additional 2 billion in share repurchases. Several board members, managers, and I have also bought shares personally. But what will ultimately close the gap between our stock price and intrinsic value as we see it? We will continue to focus on everything within our control. We will run our businesses at the highest levels and invest behind our winners. Where we are falling short, we will learn. We will also strive to communicate more clearly. As the great Dr. Seuss once said, sometimes the questions are complicated and the answers are simple. To that end, we simplified our intrinsic value calculation. In last year's annual letter to shareholders, I discussed the building blocks of Markel Group's intrinsic value. The framework we provided in our press release this morning takes those principles and simplifies them further. We provide this not as a fixed number but to show how we begin to think about the intrinsic value growth of Markel Group. It's a starting point. I'd also encourage placing less stock in the precise number and more in the rate of change you can see over time when you calculate this consistently year after year. The record will show that the number has compounded at high rates over the last five years and since our IPO in 1986. Our recent growth benefited from a period of above-average returns in our equity portfolio. We must improve our insurance results to reach our full potential in the next five years. We must also live our values, serve our customers, and communicate with our long-term partners who trust us with their capital. I am confident we will do just that. Just as the coxswain calls out when it's time for the rowers to give it everything they've got, we know that it's time for us to make those hands fly. Before I turn it over to Brian, I would like to welcome some new team members. In 2024, we welcomed two new businesses and their leaders, Valor and EPI, to our team. Valor Environmental joined the family in June. Valor, founded by JJ Mandato and Kirk Foster, offers erosion control and stormwater management services. These are required for anyone moving dirt and water in the U.S. With JJ and Kirk, we found common ground in our shared values and focus on customer service. We also welcomed Debra Martin and her team at EPI to the family in September. However, we could not formally and publicly welcome them at that time due to the pending nature of certain final regulatory approvals that were just recently received. We were happy to make things official in January. After a career as an educator, Debra founded EPI, which sponsors an exchange visitor program for teachers. It serves school districts in the Southeast and Mid-Atlantic U.S. states. Welcome to Valor and EPI. With that, I'll turn the call over to Brian, who will go through some of our financial numbers from 2024. He will then turn it over to Jeremy, who will talk about performance in the insurance business. Brian. Brian Costanzo -- Chief Financial Officer Thank you, Tom. Good morning, everyone. I will first review key metrics at the Markel Group level. Then I will share performance numbers for our insurance and ventures businesses, plus our investment results. At the group level, let me begin by talking a bit more -- in a bit more detail about the intrinsic value that Tom mentioned. Before getting into the specific numbers, I'll offer you a surgeon general's warning for our simple approach. As Tom suggested, we intentionally left our calculation at the 100 course level, simple and easy to follow, designed for ease of use and interpretation. It should be used with an awareness of its limitations such as determining an appropriate multiple involves considering many factors, including the nature of the various cash flow streams. We just picked one that seemed reasonably conservative. Twelve times is not the multiple we would pay for a business nor would we consider buying a business for less than 12 times to be automatically accretive to intrinsic value. Items that are one-time in nature have not been adjusted for such as disposal gains or losses. All good things for an analyst to consider. The value of equities is a snapshot in time as of the end of each year, and the world is dynamic. Like commercials that you would see for medications, using this formula as a precise measure could cause dizziness, headaches, tunnel vision, or other side effects. You get the point, and I could go on and on with those like they tend to at the end of those commercials and actually spend more time with that than what the purpose of the calculation is. But I think that makes the illustration. Recognizing these limitations of the approach, we believe that our simplified method provides an annual insight into how we think about value creation when viewed over longer time periods. Details of our intrinsic value calculation can be found in the back of this morning's press release. Using our intrinsic value calculation and taking a five-year view, Markel Group's intrinsic value compounded at 18.3% over the last five years. This is compared to total shareholder return over the same period growing at 8.6%, highlighting the gap that Tom mentioned previously. Beginning at the -- at the beginning of 2024, we began reporting our operating income for investments, ventures, insurance and on a consolidated basis. Operating income is a key driver of intrinsic value and our long-term incentives. If you must pick one metric for our scorecard, operating income is a good place to start. Markel Group's operating income was 3.7 billion in 2024, up from 2.9 billion in 2023. As Tom noted, the largest contributor to operating income was unrealized gains in our equity portfolio. Breaking down our operating income by engine. Insurance operating income was 601 million for the year and 143 million in the fourth quarter. Insurance operating income includes our global underwriting profits, along with fee-based income from Nephila and State National. Investments operating income was 2.8 billion for the year and 367 million in the fourth quarter. Our annual investment operating income further breaks down as 913 million of recurring net investment income; 1.8 billion of net investment gains, largely from the mark on our equity portfolio; and 52 million of earnings from equity method investments. Ventures operating income across our 21 businesses was 520 million for the year and 132 million in the fourth quarter. The beauty of the Markel Group's system lies in the fact that these diversified streams produce a river of cash flow. Operating income is generally convertible into cash that can be redeployed. Growth in insurance premiums and the time lag of paying reserves also generates cash, further fueling reinvestment. This growth generates future operating cash flows all in a cost- and tax-efficient manner. Our total cash flows from operating activities in 2024 totaled 2.6 billion, driven largely by our insurance engine. Moving to our insurance operations. In insurance, we serve our customers through specialized underwriting, building lasting partnerships with our distribution partners, focusing on the long term, our strong balance sheet, and maximizing our people-powered culture. First, a comment about natural catastrophe losses. During 2024, we incurred 71 million or just under 1 point of losses related to Hurricane Helene and Hurricane Milton. These losses have come down from our original estimates and are well within our expectations for events of this size. Further, while it is still early days, for the California wildfires, we disclosed an estimated $90 million to $130 million impact on our first quarter 2025 results. This estimate is inclusive of losses and reinstatement premiums across our global underwriting operations. This range includes no provision for potential salvage and subrogation recoveries, and we have minimal premiums subject to the California FAIR Plan. While several of our first-party product lines will have losses, our largest impact is in our international fine arts and specie book. Overall, our underwriting teams have done an excellent job of minimizing our exposure to wildfire losses. Moving to our segment results, starting with our insurance segment, which largely represents our specialty and international divisions. Gross written premium was 9.4 billion and net earned premium was 7.4 billion in 2024, each representing a 2% increase from a year ago. Insurance premiums grew despite numerous portfolio actions that reduced premiums in our U.S. casualty and risk managed professional lines taken to improve the balance of the portfolio. The combined ratio was 94.3%, versus 97.8% in 2023, an improvement of 3.5 points, driven by higher prior accident year loss takedowns and our underwriting actions starting to earn through, with more benefits from these actions expected in 2025 and beyond. Our current accident year loss ratio was 64.4% in both 2024 and 2023. Prior-year loss development was 6.1 points favorable in 2024, versus 1.4 points favorable in 2023, due to actions taken in 2023 to strengthen reserves in our casualty portfolio and prior -- higher prior-year loss takedowns this year in our international portfolio. The expense ratio was 36% in 2024, versus 35% in 2023, with the 1-point increase driven by the decline in earned premiums in the U.S. from the underwriting actions and changes in our professional liability reinsurance structure and higher operating expense ratio in our international operations to support investment and growth initiatives. Our exited collateral protection insurance product line, or CPI, added 2.3 points on the insurance segment results this year, versus 1.3 points last year. We expect the impact of CPI losses on our results to decrease in 2025. Jeremy will speak later about what we've done this past year and are further doing in 2025 to improve the long-term results within our U.S. specialty business. Moving to our reinsurance segment. Reinsurance underwriting profit continues to trail our targets with a combined ratio of 101 for the year. Higher attritional loss ratios in our professional and general liability products drove this. We also had some large individual losses within our credit and surety products. Our prior-year loss ratio was slightly favorable this year, and we had 34 million or 3 points of adverse development this year from our recently discontinued public entity product line. Turning next to our program services and ILS businesses, aka State National and Nephila. In 2024, State National had strong, consistent performance, with operating profits of 122 million; and Nephila produced operating income of 41 million, a bit lower than last year. However, the 2023 results included 31 million in one-time fee income related to releasing capital from side pockets. Turning next to our results from Markel Ventures. In ventures, our operating businesses are autonomous and accountable. We use equity capital to acquire our family of businesses while promoting a long-term focus and our shared set of values. We seek companies with lasting competitive advantages that provide strong steady returns on capital across economic cycles. Within certain of our businesses, cycles will and do occur. We price that into our underwriting. As to our 2024 revenues, total revenues exceeded 5 billion for the first time in our history, experiencing year-over-year growth of 3%. Our consumer and building products businesses drove the majority of ventures' growth while transportation-related businesses took a step back. As context, transportation-related demand has been very strong since the first half of 2020, providing a tailwind for our market-leading businesses in this sector the past few years. Historically, these businesses typically experience five- to 10-year cycles, with the rising need for transportation equipment and predictable replacement cycles fueling growth from one cycle to the next. So, while revenues have come down from the high points of the cycle, these are businesses that particularly benefit from our long-term high equity capital approach. Additionally, our construction services businesses, our largest grouping by total revenues, saw a deceleration in growth this year compared to last with flat year-over-year revenue growth when excluding the addition of Valor in June. Like transportation-related markets, demand for construction services was particularly strong post-COVID. Although elevated interest rates present a challenge for construction activity in this economic climate, we consider flat recurring revenue growth to be a solid result for this group. Ventures operating income was 520 million for the year. Within both our equipment manufacturing and consumer and building products businesses, strong revenue growth drove even stronger operating income growth over the past two years. Although we noted that revenues across all of our construction services businesses were flat, excluding Valor, the construction services operating margins did decline slightly. Now, moving over to our investments. Through our public equity portfolio, we own interests in many of the best businesses in the world. We seek out profitable businesses with good returns on capital, management teams with integrity and talent, and companies that have attractive reinvestment opportunities and are available at reasonable valuations. Our equity portfolio earned a 20.1% return with 1.8 billion in net investment gains included in our 2024 operating income. The equity portfolio averaged a compound annual growth rate of 14.3% over the last five years. We don't expect these returns to be repeated in the next five years, but we're pleased with our portfolio. It has and should compound capital at attractive rates over long periods. Net investment income was 920 million in 2024, versus 735 million last year. For 2024, our fixed income book yield was 3.2%. In the fourth quarter, we continued to add new fixed income investments at higher yields, approximately 4.4%, versus maturing bonds at approximately 3.6%. Ninety-eight percent of our bond portfolio was held in fixed income securities that are rated AA or better. Now, we'll turn it over to Jeremy, who will provide more commentary on insurance. Jeremy A. Noble -- President, Insurance Great. Thanks, Brian, and hello, everyone. I'd like to begin by adding my thanks to the efforts of my teammates in 2024. As was mentioned earlier, we have many areas across the business that are performing exceptionally well. This year, we saw continued strong performance in our international and State National operations, both grew while achieving profitability levels above our targets. We are investing in these businesses to support their long-term growth. Within our specialty business, our personal lines, property, marine, healthcare, environmental, programs, commercial professional liability products, and most of our small commercial offerings also exceeded our targets. We continue to drive profitable growth in these areas. These lines represented over half of our gross written premiums in 2024. As we have noted, underperformance in our U.S. casualty and risk management professional liability books weighed on our results. And as a result, our overall U.S. specialty business fell short of our expectations. We have taken numerous actions during 2024. First, early last year, we exited several product lines, including primary casualty retail, business owners policy, risk managed excess construction, risk managed architects and engineers, and collateral protection insurance. These exits were accretive to our 2024 results and will be further accretive in 2025. Second, we took more than 100 underwriting actions across our portfolio, including meaningfully reducing the construction mix in our casualty portfolio, changing terms and conditions to eliminate certain exposures to subcontractors, reducing limits on excess lines, and implementing premium caps in challenging states, achieving double-digit rate increases across the casualty portfolio while walking away from risks that were not adequately priced and terminating certain underperforming programs. In risk managed professional liability products, nonrenewing business, contracting limits, and improving portfolio mix through segmentation. In our most challenged class, U.S. public D&O, we recently announced further actions to move to a single access point for public D&O and large financial institutions coverage based in Bermuda. In total, these actions, in addition to the exits mentioned in my first point, resulted in a reduction to gross written premiums of over $350 million in 2024, but it should be accretive to net income. Third, we bolstered our reserves by increasing our overall level of conservatism on the current accident year by approximately 2 points, which roughly offset the benefits from our underwriting actions earned in 2024. By adding a margin of safety to our current reserves, we increase the likelihood of greater prior-year redundancies in future periods. Fourth, we refreshed the leadership team. Over the past 14 months, we appointed a new president of our specialty division and added a new divisional chief underwriting officer, COO, CIO, and CFO to complement our product and field leaders. And fifth, we made progress on our multiyear effort to improve our technology. We are investing heavily to make it easier and more exciting to do business with us and improve the customer experience by enhancing our underwriting and claims processes. We will give our underwriting claims and actuarial teams richer data. These investments will help us make better decisions, find insights faster, and improve efficiency. As Tom alluded to earlier, what tangible signposts can you track along the way to measure our progress and what does success look like and how long will it take? While we strive to provide perspective on these important questions as we progress, let me say today, our combined ratio of 95.2 is still higher than it should be. We expect our actions to drive the underlying combined ratio lower in '25 and even more so beyond. Prior-year takedowns in 2024 were 5.4%, a great improvement but still not at our long-term average of 6 points to 8 points. Finally, we recently announced the go-live for our Guidewire claims module, an important next step in the modernizing of our U.S.-based technology architecture, which will significantly improve our claims handling experience and, over time, our operating efficiency. This is progress, but we are not stopping there. We acknowledge that we still have work to do with underwriting actions, technology investments, and operating efficiency enhancements. We are committed to long-term success. Before concluding, I'd be remiss if I didn't highlight the excellent performance of Markel International, which, in 2024, delivered a sub-80 combined ratio, with strong growth while making notable investments in new products and markets. Well done, team. Thank you to the entire insurance team for improving our business in 2024. The fruits of all our labors are not yet fully manifested in our results. To that, I'd say stay tuned. We are excited by our long-term prospects. We look forward to updating you on our progress in the coming quarters and years. With that, I'll pass it back to Tom. Thomas Sinnickson Gayner -- Chief Executive Officer Thank you, Jeremy. To conclude, in 2024, Markel Group exceeded our return targets with strong returns from our public equity portfolio, continued growth in ventures, and notable performance in many areas of our insurance business, all while staying true to our values and striving for excellence. Over the past two years, Markel Group has made significant strides. As we continue to build on this progress, we are committed to enhancing our insurance operating performance and driving profitable growth across our family of businesses. We are excited for 2025 and the work ahead and to continue winning for shareholders, customers, and associates. With that, we will open up for questions and answers. Mike Heaton, the COO of Markel Group, will also join me. Jeremy and Brian are in the room to take your questions. Operator. Questions & Answers: Operator Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator instructions] We'll take our first question from Mark Hughes at Truist. Mark Hughes -- Analyst Yeah. Thank you. Good morning. This may venture into forbidden territory, but I'm just sort of curious on the feedback you received on the business, how much do you feel like was a structure, just the -- all the different components of what you do as opposed to execution, just how successful you've been on operating in that structure? Thomas Sinnickson Gayner -- Chief Executive Officer Yeah, Mark, it's really a mix of both. So, I think in terms of the structure, the issue is sometimes people have suggested that they can't understand or the clarity is not what it should be and they would like things to be presented in a different way and more clarity. And I think the press release that we put out today in the fourth quarter result, just the whole package is our first pass at trying to address that. Secondly, in terms of execution, we've publicly said for a while now that we've had some challenges, particularly in the insurance business, and there are areas where we can and should do better. So, we're continuing in that theme and continuing to do the hard work of delivering and executing on those businesses. But it's a combination of both. Mark Hughes -- Analyst Understood. When we think about the intrinsic value calculation for Markel Ventures, how does that compare to the carrying value? And I apologize if it's a -- I can pull it out of the release, but just curious whether you can give a sense of that. Thomas Sinnickson Gayner -- Chief Executive Officer Yes. In very general terms, it would be more. So, again, part of the way in which we're laying out some of the pieces of the intrinsic value is, again, to address the rate of change in value that happens over time. So, it's not a single-point estimate, it's having a methodology that you can repeat and do year after year after year after year. And because GAAP accounting has sort of different approaches of how it would recognize things that happen inside a financial business such as insurance compared to a nonfinancial business such as those that comprise ventures, this is the way that I as a fellow owner of Markel think about the economic progress of the Markel Group over time. And we've been talking -- this is not new. We've been talking about this in the annual report the last couple of years. So, it's not about the point estimate. It's about having a consistent methodology that you do year by year by year to try to amplify and clarify what GAAP accounting might suggest in order to get the real economics of what's happening in the businesses. Mike Heaton -- Chief Operating Officer Also, not a five -- Mark Hughes -- Analyst So, basically, the -- yeah, please. Mike Heaton -- Chief Operating Officer Sorry. Yeah, also not a five-component metric. It's really just taking the whole thing as a whole. So, your question about ventures specifically, I mean, in fact, what you've got is a bit of a blended multiple of many different streams of cash flow. So, we didn't think about it separately. Mark Hughes -- Analyst Yeah. OK. And then when we think about top-line opportunities, say, within the insurance segment, you've made a lot of progress in your underwriting. I think you had some favorable developments on 2024 within some of the casualty lines, maybe GL, if I thought properly. Is it time to start growing again in 2025 or is there an opportunity to grow the top line? How should we think about the outlook here? Thomas Sinnickson Gayner -- Chief Executive Officer Yeah, I'll let Brian comment about the specifics of the numbers there. But in terms of growth, when we execute our business well, growth seems to follow, and profitable growth is what we're emphasizing around here. That's first and foremost. And again, we think in longer-term time frames around here. Five years at a time is the way we calculate our incentive compensation, for instance, at the highest levels. And there hasn't been any five-year period that I'm aware of that we were doing less business than what we did with the five-year chunk before that. Brian. Jeremy A. Noble -- President, Insurance Yeah. Hey, it's Jeremy. I'll add to that just to say the key for us, as Tom was alluding to, is just getting on the other side of those corrective actions. As we kind of mentioned in some of the prepared remarks, we have been seeing and we are growing across a number of product areas, both in the U.S. and internationally. The good news is we've managed to offset all of the reductions in premium volume that we experienced over the year. Those continued reductions where we were taking underwriting actions, that will continue to play out a little bit in '25, and we should get to more normalized growth levels over time once we get on the other side of that corrective action. Mark Hughes -- Analyst Thank you. Operator We'll go next to Andrew Kligerman at TD Securities. Andrew Kligerman -- Analyst Hey. Good morning. Kind of curious, you know, you had 5.2 percentage points of favorable prior-year development. Could you share with us the geography of that prior-year development? And I'm most interested in the casualty side because I know that's been a rough line for you. Could you talk about whether that piece, casualty, was favorable or unfavorable and to what degree and what underwriting years? Thomas Sinnickson Gayner -- Chief Executive Officer I'll let Brian and Jeremy chime in on the specific way to answer that question, but I do want to reiterate, getting back to the fundamental principles and the fundamental values of the Markel Group, we have, from day one, always wanted our reserves to be more likely to be redundant than deficient. And I think you can just randomly ask any person in this building in any Markel office anywhere in the world, and they would tell you that almost word for word. That is drilled into our culture. So, we're glad to be back this year, reporting something that has way more redundancy than it did last year, and it's getting back to our historical level of conservatism and reserve development in a positive way. Brian Costanzo -- Chief Financial Officer Yeah, I'd say, generally speaking, you know, last year, we hit the casualty really hard. So, if you look at year over year, adverse development in casualty. This year, fairly flat in the casualty on a net basis. So, those actions have largely held up throughout the year on a net basis. Within professional, it's kind of a mix story. On the international side, we had takedowns here. That business is a lot different than the business we were talking about in the U.S. So, that was a catalyst of takedowns this year. We did have some adverse development on the U.S. D&O line, the risk managed lines that we were talking about earlier. But overall, the five points, like Jeremy said, that's closer to our normal run rate with kind of the way in which we do reserving. So, we have kind of a naturally embedded kind of takedown in the way we do our reserving, and that's kind of what you're seeing come through the results this year. Andrew Kligerman -- Analyst Got it. And any casualty -- and any of the negative adverse casualty in recent underwriting years? Brian Costanzo -- Chief Financial Officer Yeah. So, what I would say there is we kept a close eye on that. We have been increasing slightly there on a gross basis. We have a reinsurance program that kind of limits the downside on a net basis there. So, overall, it's relatively flat. Andrew Kligerman -- Analyst Got it. That's super helpful. And it is kind of interesting you're kind of -- you know, it seems like you're moving your mix more to short-tail lines. So, last year, for net earned premium, general liability was 29% and professional -- and last year, meaning 2023, and professional was 25%. Has that mix changed? Is it materially more short-tail? Has GL and professional come down a fair amount for 2024? Jeremy A. Noble -- President, Insurance Hey, Andrew. It's Jeremy. I would not say the mix has changed materially. We -- as you pointed to, we've historically been more concentrated in longer-tail lines. And even with taking some corrective actions in areas like our U.S. general liability and professional liability spaces, we're still weighted more in that space. So, look, we're trying with each of our over 100 major product lines to write in the market that's most attractive, where we feel we can deploy capital and earn appropriate returns. And we don't sort of necessarily think about, you know, just long-tail versus shorter-tail. So, it's a little bit of a mix story in that space but nothing material. Andrew Kligerman -- Analyst Got it. I'll hop back into the queue, so others can ask questions. Operator We'll move next to Andrew Andersen at Jefferies. Andrew Andersen -- Jefferies -- Analyst Hey. Good morning. Sounds like some pretty strong results on the international side of the house. Can you just remind us what percentage of the insurance segment is that? And I guess the reason I'm asking is if we look at some, you know, large account skewed surveys, it seems to indicate international pricing is kind of going negative. Perhaps you could talk about what you're seeing in your international business in terms of rate? Jeremy A. Noble -- President, Insurance Yeah. Hey, Andy. It's Jeremy. So international, roughly, call it, a third, and two-thirds would be sort of the U.S. insurance. You're right in pointing out that in the international space -- and again, if you think about that, we've got a large London market wholesale business, where we write a lot of specialty lines, and then we really have our regional presence: Canada, U.K. across continental Europe, Asia-Pacific. So, trends and dynamics in those local markets can change a little bit. In the London market space, to your point, it's been a little bit of a transitioning market. Prices are coming off of where they've been. And in some places, they're modestly flat to down or only up slightly. However, that's off a very attractive level, I think, of rate adequacy. So, we're monitoring that, but that business is performing very strong, to your point, in recent years. Andrew Andersen -- Jefferies -- Analyst Thanks. And maybe just keeping on pricing, I think I heard you say double-digit rate increases across casualty portfolio. I'm assuming that's U.S. casualty, but maybe you could just give us some more color on what the U.S. portion is seeing in terms of rate and whether that's above loss trend. Jeremy A. Noble -- President, Insurance Yeah. Sure. Again, it's Jeremy. And you're right. So, casualty pricing has been one of the stronger areas in the portfolio. And really, we saw the pricing being pretty strong over the course of '24. That continued to be the case in the fourth quarter. That's across the portfolio, and there's a number of classes in line. So -- but across the portfolio, double digit-rate increases. That would be staying slightly ahead of trend, and I don't see any reason why that pricing environment shouldn't persist as we go into '25. We talked about, and obviously it's pretty widely understood across the industry, given inflationary drivers, elevated loss costs, market dynamics, you know, I would expect to continue to see pricing momentum in that space. Andrew Andersen -- Jefferies -- Analyst Thank you. Jeremy A. Noble -- President, Insurance Yes. Operator Next, we'll move to John Fox at Fenimore Asset Management. John Fox -- Fenimore Asset Management -- Analyst Yeah. Good morning, everyone. Thomas Sinnickson Gayner -- Chief Executive Officer Good morning. John Fox -- Fenimore Asset Management -- Analyst I have two questions. First, Tom, you mentioned more disclosure in the formatting, which I noticed in this release, and I appreciate it. So, that's a nice job. First question, Tom, you mentioned in the first sentence of this release about your targets, which were exceeded this year and then maybe not longer term in the conference call. So, can you express, you know, what are those targets that you're thinking about? Thomas Sinnickson Gayner -- Chief Executive Officer Well, the main ones that would have the most tangible impact on yours truly, as well as the people sitting around the table, is the compensation calculations that you find in the proxy statement. And at double-digit rates of return in operating income and market price per share, you know, we started paying nice incentives. So, you can start there and work backwards. John Fox -- Fenimore Asset Management -- Analyst OK. Great. And then I just have a question on how you think about the intrinsic value per share. Looking at the table, I think you're using gross equity securities, the 11.8 billion, and some amount of gross investments, but there's an offsetting liability. You owe your policyholders $26 billion, which, of course, will be paid out over time. So, probably present value less than that. But how do you think about using gross investments in the intrinsic value with a -- there is a liability that, you know, those investments are going to go out the door at some point. So -- Thomas Sinnickson Gayner -- Chief Executive Officer Yeah. John Fox -- Fenimore Asset Management -- Analyst Just how do you think about that? Thank you. Thomas Sinnickson Gayner -- Chief Executive Officer Yeah. Sure. And I invite you to think about it however you want to, and I can assure you that there were robust discussions and points of view that had some differences from the people in this room. And the real point is you can do it any way you want but do it consistently. So, one extreme way of thinking about the question you've asked, and Buffett really deserves the credit for being the first person who realized this and built his business around it, is that if you have insurance liabilities and you make an underwriting profit on them and they don't go down over time, I mean, the net present value of that liability is zero. Now, that yields a rather extreme answer, which my colleagues cautioned me away from, OK. So, we've applied some haircuts, some conservativism, but that is theoretically within the realm of possibility. So, you can get a pretty big dispersion of numbers, depending on your method. The thing that really is worthy and doesn't have much dispersion to it is the rate of change over time. And the longer the time frame you use, the tighter the dispersion no matter what your method, and the more accurate it becomes. And that's the way we think about intrinsic value per share. John Fox -- Fenimore Asset Management -- Analyst OK. Thank you. Operator [Operator instructions] We'll take our next question from Scott Heleniak at RBC Capital Markets. Scott Heleniak -- RBC Capital Markets -- Analyst Yeah. Good morning. Is there anything notable to share at the January 1 renewals, both on your reinsurance book and just, you know, from a buyer of reinsurance standpoint? Anything you can talk to there? And the secondary question on the reinsurance side is the exit of public entity, is that -- can you remind me when that happened? Is that pretty much close to being anniversaried? Jeremy A. Noble -- President, Insurance Yeah, Scott, it's Jeremy. I'll take the second one first. So, with regards to the exit of public entity, we announced that right at the beginning of the fourth quarter. So, I think we touched upon that a quarter ago. That really went into effect this past fourth quarter. And public entity probably contributed about 4 points to the reinsurance combined ratio in the year. So, that will -- we're off risk now, but that happened in the fourth quarter and that will -- the benefit of that will earn over the course of the next several quarters. With regards to 1/1, let me talk first to your point about our outwards reinsurance, so where we buy reinsurance. Overall, pretty pleased. I mean, I would call the market orderly in some pockets such as property. And, say, our marine and energy out of London, favorable terms, favorable pricing, good support, and it's certainly a good outcome. That's improvement year over year. Professional, which we placed late in the year, was kind of flat on pricing. We kept the structure the same. Casualty, probably no surprise there. A little bit of an uptick in pricing. But all in all, good result, good support, pleased with the structures we have in place. Not a lot of change year over year. As far as the overall pricing conditions in marketplace going into the year, you know, we're not massive necessarily on one. And obviously, we have more modest totals for the reinsurance book. I would say most of the pricing trends that either I touched upon earlier or that you've generally heard across the marketplace played true for us as well. Scott Heleniak -- RBC Capital Markets -- Analyst OK. No, that's really good detail. And then just you referenced the increase in IT spending in the fourth quarter, and you mentioned as well in the third quarter. Is there any more detail that you can share on those investments? And do you expect that kind of run rate to continue in 2025 or do you feel like a lot of the heavy lifting is done? I know IT spending is never done, but just because you had mentioned the last couple of quarters, any context you can give on any of that? Jeremy A. Noble -- President, Insurance Yeah. Sure. Good question. We -- I mean, really, we've been pretty hard at work, I would say, making incremental investments in our technology modernization initiatives, both in our U.S. and international insurance businesses, let's call it over the last couple of years but really accelerating this past year and more so this coming year. I won't specifically quantify the level of investment, but it is incrementally adding, you know, at least 0.5 point to the expense ratio, and those benefits will start to come over time. So, gave an example, you know, with regards to claims modernization in the U.S. And here, pretty shortly, we'll be transacting new claims on a new cloud-based modernized platform that will drive productivity and efficiency over time. But we've got a number of initiatives taking place both in the U.S. and internationally. Scott Heleniak -- RBC Capital Markets -- Analyst OK. Great. That's helpful. And just the last one, just on U.S. professional liability. Do you know that's -- that's been, you know, more competitive market. You've seen softening in pricing just, you know, marketwide, and I know that's an area where you guys had started to pull back probably a year or more. Are you seeing stabilization in that? Do you expect to, you know, return to growth in that for 2025 or is it still highly competitive and you still may not want to grow in that given what's happening now? Jeremy A. Noble -- President, Insurance Yeah, it's Jeremy again. And your -- the latter, I would say, is the case. It continues to be a very challenging sector. You know, pricing is not, I think, at levels of rate adequacy. We have scaled back this past year, and that will continue to be the case as we go into '25. It's just -- it's not an area of emphasis for us right now because the marketplace is not supportive. Scott Heleniak -- RBC Capital Markets -- Analyst Great. Appreciate all the answers. Operator We'll go to a follow-up from Andrew Kligerman at TD Securities. Andrew Kligerman -- Analyst Great. Thanks for the follow-up. Just following up on the expense ratio. So, it was at 37.1%, about 170 basis points above last year's, and you just pointed out 50 basis points from investments in technology and seeing improvements over time. And of course, earlier, you mentioned scale is an issue as you've decreased earned premium a little bit, changes in reinsurance. But as I think about it, you know, where would you like to see this expense ratio maybe three, five years from now? Are there any initiatives to get that down? I mean, will it just be the efficiencies from your technology investing right now? Could there be more initiatives? Maybe a little color on what else is occurring and where you'd like to see it maybe three to five years from now? Jeremy A. Noble -- President, Insurance Yeah, thanks. It's Jeremy. A couple of things there. So, first off, I think with regards to the fourth quarter and that expense ratio being elevated, that is really because of a spike in the period that will not recur. It was associated with catching up on recognizing some contingent commissions in both our international and specialty divisions on profitable lines of business where we have been growing. So, first, I would say think of our sort of full year expense ratio maybe as a better indicator of where we are. The second point that you're acknowledging is we would acknowledge that expense ratio is elevated to where our longer-term objectives would be, and we are taking actions. I would tell you, if you thought of our expense ratio for the full year, in the U.S., that expense ratio is up about 0.5 point. In our international operations, it's up about 2.5 points. And that is really because, as I mentioned, sub-80 combined, higher profit-sharing costs. We're actually investing significantly in the business. So, we've been growing geographically, opening new offices and locations in new countries. Australia is a good example of that. We're making investments across Asia-Pacific and the continental Europe. We've added product capability. So, we're writing international casualties. We've added power to our sustainable energy platform. So, we're investing in that business, and that's having a bigger impact on the expense ratio but wonderful results in that business. In the U.S., the 0.5 point is impacted by the portfolio corrective actions we've taken and then also the investments we're making in technology. So, as we stabilize, get on the other side of corrective actions, get back to more normalized levels of growth, and as we start to receive the benefits of the investments we're making in product growth and geographic expansion internationally, as well as the technology modernization, we're going to see that come down. What does that look like? I mean, there's certainly over -- you said three to five years, so I can be a little bit more open there. I mean, a couple of points of improvement is certainly something that would be an objective of ours. Andrew Kligerman -- Analyst Yeah, that's very helpful. Thanks for that detail. I guess one more, you know, on the intrinsic value, and the preface of dizziness and headache, I have to say, I got a little bit of that. And, you know, Tom, you mentioned incentive comp, and I'd like a little more clarity on how that's measured. Is it over a five-year period? Because as I looked at the chart that you provided in the second page of your release, you started with 2020 for your intrinsic value, which is the COVID year. And, you know, you earned about 1.3 million in operating income versus 2021, which was 3.2 million or 3.3 million. And then if I look back even at 2019, you earned 2.5 billion. And then if I look at the insurance ops, you know, if I look at 2021, you earned 718 million. And this year, it was 601 million. So, I guess, you know, my key question is around incentive comp, is it a five-year basis so that if we had -- you had that COVID year in 2020, is that going to generate a lot of compensation when there were really some, you know, difficult circumstances in that year? Thomas Sinnickson Gayner -- Chief Executive Officer Yeah, this is Tom. It is over a five-year rolling average. So, all those years get added in to come up with the five-year number. I might remind you that 2020 subtracted from our compensation for a couple of years. So, it does roll off and mature, and there are some smiles around the faces as we do get past the pre-COVID to post-COVID comparisons. But I would refer you to our proxy statement. We try to lay it out as clear as we possibly can. We've been consistent in the calculation method for many years. And in our 38-year history as a public company, we've made very few changes. I mean, every number of years that there might be some update into the calculation and the hurdle rates that are involved. But the basic structure and the basic theory of pay for performance and making sure that our shareholders get paid first, that's been consistent since day one and will be going forward. Andrew Kligerman -- Analyst That sounds very fair. OK. Thanks a lot. Operator And next, we'll move to John Fox at Fenimore Asset Management. John Fox -- Fenimore Asset Management -- Analyst Hey. Good morning. I have a follow-up for Jeremy. I was a little bit surprised to see the gross and net written premium volume growth in reinsurance given that it's been a poor underwriting record over time. So, could you just maybe talk about why that was growing? Jeremy A. Noble -- President, Insurance Sure, John. It's Jeremy. Ultimately, it's a little bit about sort of mix within the portfolio. So, where we have seen a little bit of growth year over year is in places like our marine and energy offerings out of the London market, places like workers' comp, maybe transactional liability, which kind of came back a little bit stronger and as far as premium volume in the overall marketplace in '24 versus '23. Where we've been more challenged, traditional areas of professional liability like D&O or in the casualty, we've been contracting in those spaces. So, some of that growth would come from how we might increase our participation or see growth in exposure or by taking advantage of maybe some new business in lines that we believe are performing and have performed better, but they're smaller aspects of the overall portfolio. John Fox -- Fenimore Asset Management -- Analyst OK. So, I mean, the implication would be better combined ratio in the future? Jeremy A. Noble -- President, Insurance We are sure are working hard at that. John Fox -- Fenimore Asset Management -- Analyst OK. Jeremy A. Noble -- President, Insurance I mean, the combined ratio in reinsurance is not -- has not been an acceptable level. So, it's got to be better. John Fox -- Fenimore Asset Management -- Analyst Right. Absolutely. OK. We'll keep an eye on that. Thank you. Jeremy A. Noble -- President, Insurance Thank you. Operator And this concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Tom Gayner for any closing remarks. Thomas Sinnickson Gayner -- Chief Executive Officer Thank you. Thank you for joining us. Thank you for your support. We look forward to reporting our progress to you as the year goes by. Have a great day.

Timeline [sued](https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.dcd.277213/gov.uscourts.dcd.277213.1.0.pdf) Trump for [trying to shutter](https://www.forbes.com/sites/siladityaray/2025/02/06/usaid-controversy-live-updates-nearly-all-of-usaids-employees-being-laid-off/) the U.S. Agency for International Development by slashing staff and halting aid, arguing it’s unconstitutional for the president to eliminate a federal agency approved by Congress—and alleging his moves “generated a global humanitarian crisis.” [paused](https://x.com/ZoeTillman/status/1887567103923720612) a Thursday deadline for over 2 million federal employees to accept a [buyout offer](https://www.forbes.com/sites/saradorn/2025/02/06/deadline-for-trumps-federal-buyout-offer-extended-by-court-as-over-40000-staff-agree-to-leave-heres-what-to-know/)—part of Trump and Musk’s cost-cutting push—as he considers whether to grant a [request](https://www.courtlistener.com/docket/69610323/american-federation-of-government-employees-afl-cio-v-ezell/) by federal workers’ unions who sued to block the buyouts, extending the deadline until Monday.

[second judge](https://www.forbes.com/sites/mollybohannon/2025/02/05/trumps-birthright-citizenship-order-indefinitely-halted-by-federal-judge/) —Deborah L.

[paused](https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.dcd.276959/gov.uscourts.dcd.276959.23.0_1.pdf) Trump’s restrictions on transgender women being incarcerated in women’s prisons and federal prisons providing gender-affirming medical treatment, after multiple inmates sued to block the policy.

[paused](https://www.forbes.com/sites/alisondurkee/2025/01/23/can-trump-end-birthright-citizenship-what-to-know-after-judge-blocks-executive-order/) Trump’s order rescinding [birthright citizenship](https://www.forbes.com/sites/alisondurkee/2025/01/23/can-trump-end-birthright-citizenship-what-to-know-after-judge-blocks-executive-order/), the first major ruling against the second Trump administration. [filed](https://www.forbes.com/sites/mollybohannon/2025/01/20/trump-will-face-first-lawsuit-targeting-elon-musks-doge-moments-after-taking-office/) minutes after he was sworn into office, as public interest law group National Security Counselors argued DOGE should be classified as a federal advisory board that has “fairly balanced” membership and follows public transparency rules. Who Else Is Suing Trump? Lawsuits have been [filed](https://www.justsecurity.org/107087/tracker-legal-challenges-trump-administration-actions/) [against](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1_ewPQoawicof0tmdyNSSWbpu_6PpPDPSB_apeMwMWm8/edit?gid=0#gid=0) a number of other Trump administration directives in cases that haven’t resulted in any rulings yet, including pending cases on Trump’s immigration policies like asylum restrictions, raids on sanctuary cities, immigration officers entering houses of worship, and restricting grants to immigration-related groups. Multiple other transgender rights-focused cases are pending, including litigation against Trump’s transgender military ban and minors receiving gender-affirming care, as well as a lawsuit challenging Trump’s broader restrictions on diversity, equity and inclusion policies. Other lawsuits that are still pending include litigation against the Justice Department targeting agents who worked on Jan. 6-related cases, Trump’s “Schedule F” that makes it easier to fire career civil servants, Trump’s firing of National Labor Relations Board member Gwynne A. Wilcox, the Office of Personnel Management allegedly storing emails on an unsecured server and the government removing health data from federal websites. Who Else Is Suing Over Elon Musk And Doge? Multiple lawsuits are also arguing Trump should not have been able to create Musk’s “Department of Government Efficiency” by renaming the U.S. Digital Service, while another challenge takes aim at DOGE accessing records at the Department of Labor. Will The Supreme Court Side With Trump? None of the lawsuits against the second Trump administration have yet made it to the Supreme Court, though at least some inevitably will. The high stakes of the lawsuits brought against Trump policies, plus the fact that bringing multiple lawsuits against a single policy may result in conflicting rulings, makes it all but certain the high court will eventually weigh in on some of the legal challenges that are now making their way through the courts. It’s unclear how the 6-3 conservative court, stacked with three Trump appointees, will ultimately rule on any challenges, though legal experts have suggested some of the administration’s moves may be too much for even the conservative-leaning court to get behind. Georgetown Law School professor Stephen Vladeck [wrote](https://www.stevevladeck.com/p/120-the-impoundment-crisis-of-2025) he was skeptical the Supreme Court would back the administration’s memo halting federal funding, for instance. He noted that while the court was willing to give Trump more power in its recent decision giving him some immunity from criminal charges, it would be “quite another” thing for them to give him “the right to refuse to spend any and all money Congress appropriates.” Legal experts have also been highly skeptical of the legal justification the Trump administration has used to justify the order nullifying [birthright citizenship](https://www.forbes.com/sites/alisondurkee/2025/01/23/can-trump-end-birthright-citizenship-what-to-know-after-judge-blocks-executive-order/), which claims the 14th Amendment—which guarantees citizenship to “all persons born or naturalized in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof”—has always exempted the children of undocumented immigrants or noncitizens. Mark Krikorian, who runs the Center for Immigration Studies and supports ending birthright citizenship, [acknowledged](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2024-election/litigation-certainty-trumps-call-end-birthright-citizenship-face-mount-rcna162314) to NBC News in July Trump’s argument is “something that the Supreme Court may well decide against,” and legal experts have previously decried the legal theory behind Trump’s order as a “lunatic fringe argument,” with University of Massachusetts, Amherst, professor Rebecca Hamlin telling [NPR](https://www.npr.org/2018/10/30/662335612/legal-scholars-say-14th-amendment-doubt-trump-can-end-birthright-citizenship-wit) in 2018 that any lawyer who believes it is “like a unicorn.” What Controversial Actions By Trump And Elon Musk Haven’t Yet Resulted In Lawsuits? Trump has already issued a number of major executive actions, and many have not yet been challenged in court, such as him pulling out of the World Health Organization, withholding federal funding from schools that allow transgender women in women’s sports, imposing tariffs on China, removing safeguards around artificial intelligence, and rescinding Biden-era climate change initiatives, including ordering federal agencies not to disburse some funding that was approved by Congress. Musk and [DOGE](https://www.forbes.com/sites/mollybohannon/2025/02/06/elon-musks-doge-reportedly-accesses-federal-workforces-personal-data-heres-what-to-know-about-doge/) have also undertaken a number of controversial moves that haven’t yet resulted in court action, including DOGE staffers accessing information for Medicare and Medicaid and [reportedly](https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2025/02/06/elon-musk-doge-ai-department-education/) using artificial intelligence to search through sensitive internal data for the Department of Education. Key Background Trump has issued a slew of executive orders in the less than three weeks he’s been in the White House, issuing broad orders on issues such as climate change, transgender rights, DEI initiatives, education, immigration, the U.S. military, abortion, the federal death penalty and more. Musk, whom Trump appointed to lead DOGE and has become one of his top advisers, has also drawn widespread controversy as DOGE has burrowed into the federal government and gained access to government information while proposing widespread cuts to spending. With Republicans holding both the White House and control of Congress, the courts have become the primary way for Democrats to issue any sort of check on the Trump administration’s actions, and House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, D-N.Y., has pointed to litigation as a key pillar of Democrats’ response to the second Trump presidency. “We’ve seen a flood and an avalanche of outrageous executive actions that have been taken by the administration and by the current president, but that has also prompted a response of righteous litigation,” Jeffries [told](https://jeffries.house.gov/2025/02/04/leader-jeffries-weve-got-to-make-sure-that-on-every-issue-republicans-are-held-to-account/) MSNBC when asked how Democrats would oppose Trump’s policies, saying the litigation strategy “will continue as we move forward.” Further Reading",forbes.com,https://www.forbes.com/sites/alisondurkee/2025/02/06/here-are-all-the-major-lawsuits-against-trump-and-musk-as-usaid-shutdown-sparks-legal-battle/,[],"['Birthright Citizenship', 'Court Ruling Against Trump Order', 'Court Rulings', 'Doge', 'Doge Treasury Records', 'Donald Trump', 'Elon Musk', 'Funding Freeze', 'Lawsuits', 'Transgender Rights']",2025-02-06,2025-02-06,0,10,92,186,11679
