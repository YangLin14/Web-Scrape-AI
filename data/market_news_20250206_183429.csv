79218608,3 reasons I'm still loading up on Nvidia shares,"There are several reasons I'm still buying Nvidia shares, including the fact that the stock is priced pretty cheaply from a P/E standpoint.","This article was originally published on [Fool.com](https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/02/06/3-reasons-why-im-still-loading-up-on-nvidia-shares/). All figures quoted in US dollars unless otherwise stated. Nvidia ([NASDAQ: NVDA](https://www.fool.com.au/tickers/nasdaq-nvda/)) shares have been [beaten down](https://www.fool.com.au/2025/01/28/why-nvidia-microsoft-and-other-us-artificial-intelligence-ai-stocks-just-crashed-usfeed/) over the past two weeks thanks to the release of DeepSeek's efficient generative AI model. Because DeepSeek reportedly trained its [artificial intelligence (AI)](https://www.fool.com.au/investing-education/ai-shares-asx/) model for less than $6 million, many investors are assuming that companies like Nvidia that supply this computing power are in trouble, as the AI hyperscalers won't spend as much because more efficient computing methods are possible. While this is a reasonable train of thought, I don't think it's valid, as there are multiple indications that Nvidia will be fine. I've got three reasons why Nvidia stock is still a buy right now, and investors would be smart to take advantage of it while it's on sale. 1. Nvidia's largest clients are still spending big The biggest fallacy from investors assuming that Nvidia is toast due to more efficient AI models becoming available is the premise that U.S. AI hyperscalers are concerned with efficiency. The reason DeepSeek chose to make its model more efficient is because it had to. DeepSeek is limited to what computing power it has access to, as the U.S. imposed strict export restrictions on Nvidia's hardware to China. As a result, DeepSeek had to train on H800 GPUs versus the more powerful H100 counterparts that are normally used in the U.S. Because it had to focus on efficiency to make the model, the result was naturally efficient. Domestic AI companies don't have these same limitations, as they have access to near-unlimited computing power without any regulations to deal with. So, they haven't focused on efficiency but are instead building out as much computing capacity as possible to produce the most powerful AI models. This is why initiatives like the $500 billion Stargate Project or companies like Meta Platforms are spending $60 billion to $65 billion on capital expenditures this year, most of which will be [directed toward AI](https://www.fool.com.au/2025/02/06/mark-zuckerberg-just-delivered-incredible-news-for-nvidia-stock-investors/) computing power. These companies will still be spending truckloads of money with Nvidia throughout 2025 and beyond, so there shouldn't be fears of Nvidia's sales slowing down in 2025. 2. Nvidia's Blackwell GPU production has yet to meet demand Another innovation Nvidia has up its sleeve is its next-gen Blackwell architecture. The Blackwell architecture far exceeds the performance of the previous-generation Hopper architecture, including being able to train AI models four times faster. These GPUs are an incredible performance boost, and many companies are trying to get their hands on them. But Nvidia can't keep up right now. During its Q3 conference call (which occurred on November 20), Nvidia CFO Colette Kress stated, ""Blackwell demand is staggering, and we are racing to scale supply to meet the incredible demand customers are placing on us."" Nvidia is still realising this growth catalyst, which bodes well for the stock in 2025. 3. Nvidia's stock can almost be considered cheap During Nvidia's run, it has rarely looked cheap. However, I'm willing to state that it has nearly reached that level. Because of Nvidia's rapid growth, using trailing earnings metrics isn't a great way to assess the stock. As a result, I'll use Nvidia's forward [price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio](https://www.fool.com.au/definitions/p-e-ratio/). Thanks to the massive drop-off, Nvidia's stock trades for just 26 times forward earnings. [NVDA PE Ratio (Forward)](https://ycharts.com/companies/NVDA/forward_pe_ratio) data by [YCharts](https://ycharts.com/) For the [growth ](https://www.fool.com.au/investing-education/growth-shares-2/)that Nvidia is putting up, that's dirt cheap. For comparison, the S&P 500 (SP: .INX) trades for 22.3 times forward earnings, so Nvidia really doesn't hold that much of a premium to the broader market. This is despite multiple growth catalysts and a generational technological shift that Nvidia is at the centre of. With Nvidia's stock down around 16% from its all-time high, I think it's a smart move for investors to take a position now, as it's rare that Nvidia goes on sale like this.

79217830,Analyst reboots Nvidia's stock price target ahead of earnings,This is what could happen next to Nvidia shares.,"When the chips are down, it's time to up the ante. It's been said that scared money never wins, but the tech sector got a fright worthy of a dozen horror flicks on Jan. 27 when the Chinese chatbot DeepSeek came bursting onto the scene like that nasty little critter from Alien. Semiconductor companies took a saber-toothed shellacking as DeepSeek's makers said they had developed a large language model system for less than $6 million, a fraction of the costs born by U.S. giants such as OpenAI and Meta Platforms (META) , with performance benchmarks that are equal to or better than those of the leading chatbots. DeepSeek’s AI Assistant quickly became the most downloaded free app in the U.S. on Apple’s (AAPL) App Store, dethroning OpenAI’s ChatGPT. AI chipmaker Sasquatch Nvidia (NVDA) got pummeled, with shares dropping 17% after DeepSeek debuted, wiping out $600 billion of the company's value. ""The introduction of the DeepSeek app was a shot across the bow for all of the players in the AI space,"" Penn Mutual Asset Management said. ""While many of the details surrounding its R1 model remain murky and quite possibly exaggerated, it’s clear that there is an arms race of sorts in the AI space."" But now is not the time to panic, Morgan Stanley analysts said on Feb. 6. Analysts say Nvidia stock still top pick The firm concluded that the DeepSeek selloff is a buying opportunity, and maintained Nvidia as a ""Top Pick"" with an overweight rating and $152 price target on the shares. While Morgan acknowledged that DeepSeek creates some headwinds around export controls and longer-term investment and that sentiment on Nvidia has worsened around potential longer-term risks, the firm said that near-term checks are firming both for the company's Hopper and ""all flavors of Blackwell."" Talking to cloud contacts, the firm said that it is hearing that ""none of this changes the plans of any of the major participants."" Morgan said that Blackwell's supply visibility continues to build and that customers' desire to spend is ""clearly on display."" Meanwhile, Citi lowered the firm's price target on Nvidia to $163 from $175 and kept a buy rating on the shares ahead of the company's quarterly earnings report Feb. 26. The firm said that it is modeling in-line results for the January and April quarters and believes expectations are for $38 billion to $42.5 billion sales for the quarters, respectively, given supply chain indications for the Blackwell to ramp more meaningfully in mid-2025 with some mix shift between GB200/300. While noting that the stock has been range-bound since June 2024 due to declining gross margins, Citi said that it expects Nvidia's gross margins to trough in the April quarter. Nvidia shares got a boost when lawmakers introduced a bill that would ban DeepSeek’s chatbot application from government-owned devices over new security concerns that the app could provide user information to the Chinese government. The bipartisan bill — written by Reps. Darin LaHood, an Illinois Republican, and Josh Gottheimer, a New Jersey Democrat — is similar to past legislation that banned TikTok from government devices, the Wall Street Journal reported. The two are the top Republican and Democrat, respectively, on a House Select Committee on Intelligence subcommittee. “This should be a no-brainer in terms of actions we should take immediately to prevent our enemy from getting information from our government,” Gottheimer said. The chatbot app has intentionally hidden code that could send user login information to China Mobile, a state-owned telecommunications company banned from operating in the U.S., according to an analysis by Ivan Tsarynny, chief executive of Feroot Security. Governments look to ban DeepSeek “Our personal information is being sent to China, there is no denial, and the DeepSeek tool is collecting everything that American users connect to it,” Tsarynny told the Journal. The analysis pushed LaHood and Gottheimer to develop the legislation. “Under no circumstances can we allow a CCP company to obtain sensitive government or personal data,” said LaHood, referring to the Chinese Communist Party. Some federal agencies, such as the U.S. Navy and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, have blocked the app due to security and privacy concerns. Texas was the first state in America to ban the chatbot on government devices, but it’s not just the U.S. looking to deep-six DeepSeek. Governments across Asia, including South Korea and Australia, are restricting their use of DeepSeek's artificial intelligence services due to security concerns, Nikkei Asia reported. Australia's Department of Home Affairs banned DeepSeek from government services, saying it posed “an unacceptable level of security risk.” The department said government entities must manage the risk of DeepSeek’s “extensive collection of data” and “exposure of that data to extrajudicial directory from a foreign government that conflicts with Australian law.” “Chinese EVs, security cameras, TikTok, and now DeepSeek show that we are playing whack-a-mole with new technology products and services from high-risk nations,” said an official at an Australian cybersecurity company. Italy took similar steps last month. Industry analysts have pushed back against DeepSeek’s low-cost claims, Reuters reported, with Bernstein’s Stacy Rasgon stating that ""it seems like a stretch to think the innovations being deployed by DeepSeek are completely unknown by the top tier AI researchers at the world's other numerous AI labs.” Penn Mutual said that DeepSeek's arrival does not appear to have changed the plans for U.S. technology companies to spend hundreds of billions of dollars on AI infrastructure in the coming years. Microsoft (MSFT) , Meta, Alphabet (GOOGL) and Amazon (AMZN) accounted for $170 billion of capex spending — predominantly for AI infrastructure through the third quarter of 2024, up 56% from a year ago. AI spending is expected to exceed a quarter trillion dollars in 2025, the firm said, and that number will likely be surpassed, ""Big tech players continually look for ways to optimize their models — and this may have been the shake-up that was needed for them to remain vigilant in their pursuit of attaining efficiencies — realizing that if they don’t find those efficiencies, someone else will,"" Penn Mutual said.",finance.yahoo.com,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/analyst-reboots-nvidias-stock-price-010700834.html,"['barl', 'jmg', 'jrn', 'ms', 'msft', 'msk', 'mwg', 'mwo', 'mwr', 'nvda']","['Consumer Discretionary', 'ETF', 'Financial Services', 'Josh Gottheimer', 'Morgan Stanley', 'Nvidia Ceo', 'Penn Mutual', 'Stock', 'Technology', 'Unknown Sector']",2025-02-07,2025-02-07,10,10,61,48,6358
