In this article, we are going to take a look at where Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) stands against the other stocks Jim Cramer recently talked about. Jim Cramer, the host of Mad Money, took a moment on Wednesday to reflect on the latest market developments as earnings season progresses, sharing his thoughts on how investors can identify stocks that are unfairly punished and present solid buying opportunities. “This market has the memory of a mayfly that creates a ton of opportunities so… I want to help you find them.” READ ALSO [Jim Cramer Shed Light on These 8 Stocks Recently](https://www.insidermonkey.com/blog/jim-cramer-shed-light-on-these-8-stocks-recently-1443733/) and [12 Stocks on Jim Cramer’s Radar](https://www.insidermonkey.com/blog/12-stocks-on-jim-cramers-radar-1442931/) Cramer stressed that time and again, he has seen growth stocks severely impacted by minor bits of bad news, such as small downgrades or slight concerns about a quarter’s performance. In these cases, he noted, the punishment rarely fits the crime, if a real issue even exists. Cramer also recently weighed in on the ongoing trade tensions with China. He urged Wall Street to start taking President Trump’s policies more seriously, pointing out that Trump had negotiated a deal that granted China a much lower tariff than Canada received. Cramer dismissed the idea that China’s response was an equal counterattack, calling such a notion “nonsense” and “idiocy.” He added: “Now, if Wall Street took Trump seriously, they’d know that China played softball with its retaliation just like Trump played softball with that 10% tariff.” He elaborated that much of the recent panic, which had escalated on Sunday night, shifted a bit to optimism, as people began to realize that the president had managed to negotiate a deal. Acknowledging the presence of hardliners within the White House who are keen on taking a tougher stance on China, Cramer noted that those individuals had lost the battle. He pointed out that Trump’s objective was to broker a deal that could generate revenue for the U.S. Treasury while providing American businesses with opportunities in China. Cramer emphasized that this goal should have been clear to anyone who had been watching the Chinese stock market, as stocks that trade in China surged recently. Our Methodology For this article, we compiled a list of 13 stocks that were discussed by Jim Cramer during the episode of Mad Money on February 5. We listed the stocks in the order that Cramer mentioned them. We also provided hedge fund sentiment for each stock as of the third quarter of 2024, which was taken from Insider Monkey’s database of 900 hedge funds. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points ([see more details here](https://www.insidermonkey.com/premium/newsletters/quarterly)). Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:[TSLA](https://www.insidermonkey.com/insider-trading/company/tesla%20inc/1318605/)) Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 99 Cramer noticed a pattern where Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA), the leading EV company, gets sold off on some piece of news and then soars when it is praised by “some accolade-loving person”. “Now we see this pattern constantly. Tesla will sell off over something, I don’t know, maybe it’s German numbers, it’s California numbers, it’s China business. I heard today that people have stopped buying Teslas because Musk turned out to be a Trumpist. I say, so what? He’s gonna solve the self-driving conundrum. Of course, Tesla always has some accolade-loving person who comes on our air and blesses it and says it’s worth a thousand dollars and it’s off to the races again and that will happen. That will happen.” Cramer has been praising Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA), not because of its CEO’s position in the political sphere but Elon Musk’s abilities as a CEO. Before the company reported its earnings in January, Cramer remarked: “Alright, then there’s Tesla. Now I think Elon Musk, get this, I think he could sell tickets to this conference call. He could command a thousand dollars, easy. The last time Tesla reported, missed numbers badly and then it proceeded to have one of the biggest runs ever. Just soared right when it reported that number, and I’ve gotta tell you, I figured it out. Actually, Morgan Stanley’s, Adam Jonas figured it out for me. He calls Tesla, after that quarter, an AI ETF. People want an IETF so they buy the stock no matter what, especially if it’s down the next day. I want you to own Tesla. Just own it.” Over the past year, Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) stock has gained over 100%. Overall TSLA ranks 3rd on our list of the stocks Jim Cramer highlighted recently. While we acknowledge the potential of TSLA as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

79218150,"Tesla, Inc. (TSLA): Among Cathie Wood’s Top Stock Picks for 2025",We recently compiled a list of the Cathie Wood,"We recently compiled a list of the [Cathie Wood’s Stock Portfolio: 2025 Stock Picks](https://www.insidermonkey.com/blog/cathie-woods-stock-portfolio-2025-stock-picks-1438452/). In this article, we are going to take a look at where Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) stands against the other stocks in Cathie Wood’s portfolio. Cathie Wood is one of Wall Street’s most contentious figures. She founded [ARK Investment Management](https://www.insidermonkey.com/hedge-fund/ark-investment-management/1267/) around ten years ago and has over three decades of experience in the financial sector, including a notable spell as chief investment officer of AllianceBernstein Holding LP’s global thematic strategies unit. An 87.4% return in the fund, driven by a 1300% growth in Grayscale Bitcoin Trust, made it one of the fund’s best years since its debut in 2017. This performance came about at a time when Bitcoin’s price had reached a record high of $20,000. Cathie Wood’s investing strategy is pretty straightforward: her ARK ETFs invest in developing high-tech firms in artificial intelligence, blockchain, medicinal technology, and robotics. Wood believes these firms can transform sectors, but their volatility causes significant fluctuations in ARK’s valuations. Although supporters of Wood hail her as a tech visionary, her detractors call her a run-of-the-mill fund manager. Additionally, despite achieving a 153% return in 2020, her long-term performance has raised questions regarding the viability of her high-risk, high-reward investment style. With $6,269 million under management, the ARK Innovation ETF has returned an annualized 14.24% over the last five years and a 12.16% year-to-date. The Nasdaq Composite, on the other hand, has an average return of 106.84% over five years. Big Ideas 2025 Following recent changes in technology markets, Cathie Wood and her ARK research team released the yearly blockbuster report “Big Ideas 2025.” Wood seems optimistic about the future of AI computing power and AI agents. She added that from the dawn of artificial intelligence in 2018, computer performance has multiplied 40 times, and by 2023, it will have exceeded 48 times. Computing performance is predicted to hit a new high by the end of this century, mainly due to the rapid growth of AI. Specifically, Cathie Wood believes that AI agents are the central subject of future development, with the potential to accelerate the adoption of digital applications and spark unfathomable changes in human-computer interaction. Narrowing it down to specific industries, these agents will also press for an increase in the use of digital wallets in e-commerce. According to ARK research, digital wallets powered by AI purchasing agents are gaining market share from traditional payment methods such as credit and debit cards, with digital wallets anticipated to account for 72% of all e-commerce transactions by 2030. Our Methodology For this article, we scanned ARK Investment Management’s Q3 portfolio and chose its top 15 stock picks. The stocks are ranked in ascending order of the fund’s stakes in them.

(NASDAQ:TSLA) is a leading manufacturer of fully electric automobiles and energy solutions. Cathie Wood labeled Tesla Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) as the world’s largest AI opportunity last year due to the release of its newest iteration of self-driving (FSD) technology, which the investor claims has the potential to revolutionize the company’s economics. For that very reason, ARK Invest published a report in June of 2024 that set a $2,600 price target for Tesla shares by 2029. On January 30, Mizuho reaffirmed its Outperform rating for Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA), reflecting its faith in the company’s standing in the market, especially as the top provider of electric vehicles in the U.S. With the Cybertruck and Optimus serving as long-term growth engines, the firm thinks Tesla is well-positioned to handle the possible loss of tax benefits and tariffs. Nevertheless, Mizuho cautions that competition in China remains a challenge for Tesla. Tesla Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) reported its fourth-quarter and full-year financials for 2024, which revealed an annual revenue of $97.15 billion. Although its gross margin of 18.23% fell short of analyst forecasts, the automaker maintained strong financials with over $2 billion in free cash flow. Aristotle Atlantic Large Cap Growth Strategy stated the following regarding Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) in its [Q4 2024 investor letter](https://www.insidermonkey.com/blog/underweight-tesla-tsla-exposure-impacted-aristotle-atlantic-large-cap-growth-strategys-performance-1442216/): “Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) detracted from performance in the fourth quarter of 2024. The stock had a strong performance in the fourth quarter, and our portfolio has an underweight position relative to the benchmark weight. Tesla reported better-than-expected third quarter earnings in late October. Given the CEO of Tesla’s position as an advisor to President-elect Trump, performance in the shares accelerated following the U.S. presidential election. There are expectations that regulation for autonomous driving will be centralized with the federal government. There have been reports in the press that tax incentives for electric vehicles will be eliminated or reduced, which could have a negative impact on Tesla’s subscale competitors.” Overall TSLA ranks 1st on our list of Cathie Wood’s top stock picks for 2025. While we acknowledge the potential of TSLA as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that certain AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

79218711,Cadillac Optiq-V To Take Aim At Tesla Model Y Performance,Cadillac is working on a second electric V-Series crossover and it could have more than 500 hp,"- Cadillac is working on an all-new Optiq-V, which could arrive next year. - It features a lightly revised exterior with new bumpers and a taller spoiler. - The model could have a dual-motor all-wheel drive system with 515 hp and 450 lb-ft of torque. Cadillac’s [V-Series](https://www.carscoops.com/tag/cadillac-v/) lineup is getting an electrifying makeover as spy photographers have snapped the first pictures of the 2026 Optiq-V. It will slot beneath the Lyriq-V, which will be launched later this year and cost $79,990. Dressed in heavy camouflage, the prototype doesn’t look too remarkable at first glance. However, a closer inspection reveals a new front bumper and a revised intake with a mesh insert, which echoes its bigger brother. We can also see what appears to be a subtle front lip. More: [2026 Lyriq-V Boasts 615 HP, Is The Quickest Cadillac Ever](https://www.carscoops.com/2025/01/2026-lyriq-v-is-the-quickest-cadillac-ever/) The sportier styling continues further back as the prototype rides on stylish 21-inch wheels. They’re backed up by a beefier braking system and it’s worth noting the front discs on the Lyriq-V are nearly 2.8 inches (71 mm) larger than on the regular model. Putting the wheels aside, it looks like the crossover will be equipped with streamlined cladding for a less bulky appearance. We can also see a taller, mid-mounted spoiler as well as a sportier rear bumper. The standard Optiq has a dual-motor all-wheel drive system producing 300 hp (224 kW / 304 PS) and 354 lb-ft (479 Nm) of torque. There’s no word on how powerful the Optiq-V will be, but Cadillac may have hinted at a precedent with the Lyriq-V, which has the same output as the [Vistiq](https://www.carscoops.com/2024/12/2026-cadillac-vistiq-first-look-a-three-row-luxury-ev-with-blackwing-levels-of-power/). If this philosophy carries over to the entry-level crossover, it should match the numbers generated by the all-wheel drive [Lyriq](https://www.carscoops.com/tag/cadillac-lyriq/). Should this pan out, we can expect a dual-motor all-wheel drive system with 515 hp (384 kW / 522 PS) and 450 lb-ft (609 Nm) of torque. Regardless of the final numbers, range will likely take a significant hit. That’s unfortunate as the 85 kWh battery pack only enables the standard model to travel 302 miles (486 km) on a single charge.",carscoops.com,https://www.carscoops.com/2025/02/cadillac-optiq-v-to-take-aim-at-tesla-model-y-performance/,['tsla'],"['Cadillac', 'Cadillac Optiq', 'Cadillac Scoops', 'Cadillac V', 'Consumer Cyclical', 'Electric Vehicles', 'Scoops', 'Stock']",2025-02-06,2025-02-06,1,8,57,94,2328

Jared May, who was listed online as an assistant media technician at Boston University, posted to the social media site Bluesky, a graphic that included pictures of several young men who allegedly work for the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE).

79216675,Who owns Tesla?,"Naturally, CEO Elon Musk owns a substantial chunk of Tesla stock but who else has skin in the game? Here's the lowdown.","This article was originally published on [Fool.com](https://www.fool.com/investing/how-to-invest/stocks/who-owns-tesla/). All figures quoted in US dollars unless otherwise stated. Elon Musk is widely recognised as the largest shareholder of Tesla ([NASDAQ: TSLA](https://www.fool.com.au/tickers/nasdaq-tsla/)) stock. However, current and prospective investors alike know he's not alone, leaving them to wonder about the bigger picture regarding who owns Tesla. One of the most recognisable electric vehicle (EV) companies on America's highways and byways today, Tesla was initially focused on the luxury market. Its sole vehicle available to drivers was the Roadster, an electric sportscar that debuted in 2008. In the years that followed, Tesla expanded its vehicle lineup to the Model S sedan in 2012 and the Model X SUV in 2015. Two years later, Tesla introduced the Model 3, an EV that sported a more affordable price tag. Rounding out the company's available vehicles, the Model Y, a compact SUV, started appearing on America's roads in 2020, while the Cybertruck debuted in 2023. Today, Tesla is developing the Semi, an electric semi-truck. In addition to its automotive segment, Tesla's energy-generation and storage segment includes its business dedicated to the ""design, manufacture, installation, sales and leasing of solar energy generation and energy storage products and related services and sales of solar energy systems incentives."" The company offers its Powerpack battery for residential and commercial-scale applications, while its Megapack is suited for utility-scale energy-storage applications. Who is the owner of Tesla? Although there's no single owner of Tesla, Elon Musk is the largest owner of Tesla stock. The company, then called Tesla Motors, was founded by Martin Eberhard and Marc Tarpenning in 2003. Musk hitched a ride with the company shortly after it was incorporated, providing more than $6 million in 2004 during its Series A funding round. At that time, Musk was appointed chairman of the company. Additionally, Musk made other investments in Tesla. For instance, he participated in Series B and Series C funding rounds before Tesla's [initial public offering (IPO)](https://www.fool.com.au/definitions/initial-public-offering/) in 2010. Although he receives considerable attention as the CEO of Tesla — a position he's held since 2008 — Musk has his focus directed to the stars as well, serving as the CEO and chairman of SpaceX. Musk is recognised as one of the most accomplished entrepreneurs of modern times. In addition to founding SpaceX, Musk founded The Boring Company and Neuralink. Reimagining urban transport, The Boring Company is attempting to alleviate city traffic by developing tunnel networks. Neuralink, on the other hand, is developing brain implants to help those who suffer from certain medical conditions. Early in his business career, Musk also achieved success as a co-founder of x.com, which eventually became PayPal. Who are the largest shareholders? Musk may be the person most closely identified with Tesla, but a number of individuals and institutions hold significant positions in the EV company. Let's take a look at the investors — both insiders and institutions — that represent the largest shareholders. Individuals - Elon Musk: As the largest individual Tesla shareholder, Musk had 410,794,076 shares of common stock as of December 2024. Musk's position represented almost 13% of the outstanding common stock. - Kimbal Musk: The younger brother of Elon, Kimbal is the insider with the second-largest position in Tesla, owning 1,538,220 shares, or 0.05% of Tesla's outstanding common stock as of December 2024. - Vaibhav Taneja: Acting as Tesla's chief financial officer (CFO) since August 2023, Taneja had 108,965 shares of Tesla's common stock, approximately 0.003%, as of December 2024. - Tom Zhu: First hired at Tesla in 2014, Zhu has served as the company's senior vice president of automotive since April 2023.

Capital World offers the Capital Group Growth ETF. Tesla represents about 5.4% of the fund's holdings. Who is on the board of directors for Tesla?

Investors often pay close attention to people on the board of directors since their stock purchases or sales may provide insight into how the company is faring.

JB Straubel: A Tesla co-founder, Straubel was the company's chief technology officer from May 2005 to July 2019, when he left to found Redwood Materials, a company specialising in recycling EV batteries and other [lithium](https://www.fool.com.au/investing-education/lithium-shares/)-ion batteries. Strauble rejoined the Tesla board in 2023. As of his latest SEC filing in 2019, Straubel had 276,398 shares of Tesla stock, although it's unclear whether he has engaged in further stock transactions since then. Robyn Denholm: Beginning as a director in August 2014, Denholm, a venture capitalist, took over as chair of the board when Musk stepped down in 2018. As of Feb. 21, 2024, Denholm had 15,000 shares of Tesla stock. In addition to chairing the Audit Committee and Disclosure Controls Committee, Denholm is a member of the Nominating and Governance Committee and the Compensation Committee. Joe Gebbia: Co-founder of Airbnb, Gebbia took a position on Tesla's board of directors in 2022. An independent director, Gebbia is a member of the Audit Committee. Kimbal Musk: Since April 2004, Musk has served as a Tesla board member. An entrepreneur who has been a Tesla board member since 2004, Musk also serves as a director for another of his older brother's endeavours, SpaceX, where Kimbal has been a board member since 2002. Kathleen Wilson-Thompson: For more than five years, Wilson-Thompson has served as a Tesla board member. An independent director, she is a member of several committees: the Nominating and Governance Committee and the Disclosure Controls Committee.

Whether you're just learning how to invest your money or you're old hat at investing in stocks, there's a strong likelihood that you've considered the advantages of buying Tesla stock. For years, the stock has electrified both [bulls](https://www.fool.com.au/definitions/bull-market/), who believe the stock can drive considerably higher, and [bears](https://www.fool.com.au/definitions/what-is-a-bear-market/), who believe the stock is consistently overvalued and poised to plummet. Cathie Wood, for example, is one of the stock's most outspoken bulls. The ARK Invest ETFs hold about 4.6 million shares of Tesla stock, and Wood has argued that Tesla stock could drive to $2,000 by 2027. For investors who find that the growth potential of Tesla stock revs their engines, buying shares is as simple as opening a brokerage account, funding the account, and clicking the buy button. On the other hand, others who are more circumspect about risk may prefer to gain Tesla exposure through an EV ETF.

79216383,Tesla Sales Fell 59% In Germany In January,"Sales of Tesla fell in Europe to start the year, falling 59% in Germany in January","Sales of Tesla fell in Europe to start the year, falling 59% in Germany in January, as [reported](https://www.ft.com/content/ea2329e4-b4bc-4e2d-be34-e9a8ea31129c) by the Financial Times. And, at least for now, as the report notes, the trend appears to be following suit throughout the rest of Europe. In January, Tesla's new car registrations in Germany plunged 59.5% to 1,277, despite hosting its sole European factory. Sales also fell sharply in France (down 63%), Norway (38%), and the UK (8%) year-over-year, FT [writes](https://www.ft.com/content/ea2329e4-b4bc-4e2d-be34-e9a8ea31129c). EV sales ""slowed sharply in Germany and France"" last year after subsidy cuts but have recently started to rebound. Despite this, Tesla’s January sales fell, dropping its German market share from 14% to 4%, even as the overall EV market grew over 50%. Analysts cite anticipation for the updated Model Y in 2025 and backlash against Elon Musk’s political activities as possible reasons for the dropoff. Schmidt Automotive Research told the New York Times that buyers in Germany could be ""reacting to Musk’s comments” about politics in Europe. In California, Tesla’s largest U.S. market, new registrations also fell 11.6% in 2024, despite overall EV sales rising 1.2%, [per the California New Car Dealers Association and NYT](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/05/business/tesla-germany-elon-musk.html). Days ago, [Tesla reported](https://www.zerohedge.com/markets/tesla-spikes-despite-soft-q4-results-after-forecasting-vehicle-business-returning-growth) a softer expected Q4 2024, but Tesla stock has mostly held up in the interim. At the time, reactions were mixed, with some bearish: “It’s clear that the market was looking for better profitability and better guidance,” said Seth Goldstein of Morningstar. “We heard on the last earnings call 20% to 30% growth, and now it’s just ‘return to growth.’ People want more firm guidance: What is the plan, and how are you going to get there?” ...and others bullish: Cathie Wood said she thinks the stock reversal was fueled, in part, by the idea that Tesla will be scaling the Cybercab in 2026 and that production has to start this year. “We can see Tesla get down to a $15,000 car,” she said on a livestream on X spaces, noting a five-year time horizon. “This is nothing a traditional auto analyst can relate to.” Recall, [we reported late last year](https://www.zerohedge.com/political/last-spark-hope-germany-musk-pens-pro-afd-op-ed-major-paper-editor-resigns) when CEO Elon Musk penned a supportive op-ed for Germany's AfD party in the country’s Welt am Sonntag newspaper... prompting the resignation of the paper's editor.

Elon Musk’s brother is also selling. Public companies must report insider stock trading by critical executives and board members to the SEC. For Tesla, it’s a very limited group for a company of that size: And they are not buying the stock. In fact, they are almost exclusively selling. Today, Tesla reported two new sets of transactions in SEC filings. Chief Financial Officer Taneja Vaibhav confirmed that he sold 7,000 shares for $2,681,770. He was able to acquire those 7,000 Tesla shares at $18.22 as part of his stock option plan. He sold at an average of $383, and the stock closed at $374 today. Robyn Denholm, Tesla’s chairwoman, sold 112,390 shares at an average price of $384.04, for a total value of $43,162,255.60. She also got the shares as part of a stock option plan. Denholm had to return tens of millions of dollars worth of Tesla stocks to the company after settling a lawsuit over excessive compensation brought by shareholders. Tesla’s entire board settled for nearly $1 billion: Tesla wrote in the filings that both Vaibhav and Denholm sold as part of stock option liquidation plans adopted last year. Today, Tesla released another SEC filing to disclose that Kimbal Musk, Elon Musk’s brother and Tesla board member who also was part of the excessive compensation settlement, is selling 75,000 Tesla shares through Morgan Stanley for $27.5 million. In his case, it doesn’t appear to be linked to a liquidation plan. Electrek’s Take Top comment by [Grant](#comments) I can only imagine how much more these insiders know than absolutely everyone else. Infer what you want on that statement. [View all comments](#comments) Kimbal is known to have great “timing” with his Tesla stock sales. It will be interesting to see. It’s wild to see these board members getting absurdly rich while the company has erased its growth and is heading into one of its worst quarters in years. All while they sit on their hands and do nothing while they are the only ones who could do something about the CEO, who seemingly engages in fireable offenses every day.

In January of 2025, only 1,277 new Teslas were registered in Germany, according to the German Federal Motor Transport Authority. This marks a 59.5% drop in sales from January of 2024. However, the German EV market has grown over 50% year after year. As a result, Tesla's market share dropped from 14% to 4% in the country containing the company's only European manufacturing plant, [reported Financial Times.](https://www.ft.com/content/ea2329e4-b4bc-4e2d-be34-e9a8ea31129c) Tesla owners in Germany are reportedly attempting to distance themselves from Musk as much as possible, with one artist and designer becoming overwhelmed with orders for a bumper sticker he created reading, ""I bought this before Elon went crazy."" The designer, who is from the south-west state of Baden-Württemberg, said he received 2,000 orders for the sticker in one weekend. Furthermore, sales of Tesla's EVs dropped by 63% in France in the month of January. Registrations of Tesla EVs fell by 38% in Norway, and by 8% from the preceding year in the UK. While demand for electric vehicles suffered a blow in France and Germany due to the removal of government subsidies, it has slowly begun to grow back. Musk unexpectedly involved himself in German politics last year, becoming a supporter of the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) party. He hosted a 75-minute discussion with Alice Weidel, the party's leader, on X, resulting in pushback from German members of government and citizens. Chancellor Olaf Scholz and his main rival, Christian Democrat leader Friedrich Merz, have both criticized the billionaire for supporting AfD, a party that advocates for the mass deportations of migrants, often uses Nazi-era adjacent slogans and is partially classified as extremist by Germany's own domestic intelligence agency.

79208005,"Tesla Dojo: Elon Musk’s big plan to build an AI supercomputer, explained",Dojo is Tesla’s custom-built supercomputer that’s designed to train its “Full Self-Driving” neural networks.,"For years, Elon Musk has talked about Dojo — the AI supercomputer that will be the cornerstone of Tesla’s AI ambitions. It’s important enough to Musk that in July 2024, he said the company’s AI team would “[double down](https://techcrunch.com/2024/07/23/tesla-robotaxi-event-october-10-elon-musk/)” on Dojo in the lead-up to [Tesla’s robotaxi reveal,](https://techcrunch.com/storyline/tesla-robotaxi-event-follow-elon-musks-big-reveals-here/) which happened in October. But what exactly is Dojo? And why is it so critical to Tesla’s long-term strategy? In short: Dojo is Tesla’s custom-built supercomputer that’s designed to train its “Full Self-Driving” neural networks. Beefing up Dojo goes hand-in-hand with Tesla’s goal to reach full self-driving and bring a robotaxi to market. FSD, which is on hundreds of thousands of Tesla vehicles today, can perform some automated driving tasks but still requires a human to be attentive behind the wheel. Tesla’s Cybercab reveal has come and gone, and now the company is gearing up to launch an autonomous ride-hail service using its own fleet of vehicles [in Austin this June.](https://techcrunch.com/2025/01/29/elon-musk-claims-tesla-will-launch-a-self-driving-service-in-austin-in-june/) Tesla also said during its [2024 fourth-quarter and full-year earnings call](https://techcrunch.com/storyline/tesla-earnings-live-updates-elon-new-evs-ai-and-more/) at the end of January that it plans to launch unsupervised FSD for U.S. customers in 2025. Musk’s previous rhetoric has been that Dojo would be the key to achieving Tesla’s goal of full self-driving. Now that Tesla appears close to nearing that goal, Musk has been mum on Dojo. Instead, ever since August 2024, talk has been around [Cortex](https://x.com/elonmusk/status/1827981493924155796?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1827981493924155796%7Ctwgr%5Edbf7c4d27a11ce65ca7cbb0810865954b25c6650%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Finsideevs.com%2Fnews%2F731363%2Ftesla-cortex-supercomputer-giga-texas%2F), Tesla’s “giant new AI training supercluster being built at Tesla HQ in Austin to solve real-world AI.” [Musk has also said](https://x.com/elonmusk/status/1819797937414611313) it will have “massive storage for video training of FSD & Optimus.” In [Tesla’s Q4 shareholder deck](https://digitalassets.tesla.com/tesla-contents/image/upload/IR/TSLA-Q4-2024-Update.pdf), the company shared updates on Cortex, but nothing on Dojo. Tesla has positioned itself to spend big on AI and Dojo — and now Cortex — to reach its goal of autonomy for both cars and humanoid robots. And Tesla’s future success really hinges on its ability to nail this down, given the increased competition in the EV market. So it’s worth taking a closer look at Dojo, Cortex, and where it all stands today. Tesla’s Dojo backstory Musk doesn’t want Tesla to be just an automaker, or even a purveyor of solar panels and energy storage systems. Instead, he wants Tesla to be an AI company, one that has cracked the code to self-driving cars by mimicking human perception. Most other companies building autonomous vehicle technology rely on a combination of sensors to perceive the world — like lidar, radar and cameras — as well as high-definition maps to localize the vehicle. Tesla believes it can achieve fully autonomous driving by relying on cameras alone to capture visual data and then use advanced neural networks to process that data and make quick decisions about how the car should behave. As Tesla’s former head of AI, Andrej Karpathy, said at the automaker’s first [AI Day in 2021](https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/19/top-five-highlights-of-elon-musks-tesla-ai-day/), the company is basically trying to build “a synthetic animal from the ground up.” (Musk had been teasing Dojo since 2019, but Tesla officially announced it at AI Day.) Companies like Alphabet’s Waymo have [commercialized Level 4 autonomous vehicles](https://techcrunch.com/2024/06/25/waymo-opens-up-san-francisco-robotaxi-service-to-everyone/) — which the SAE defines as a system that can drive itself without the need for human intervention under certain conditions — through a more traditional sensor and machine learning approach. Tesla has still yet to produce an autonomous system that doesn’t require a human behind the wheel. About 1.8 million people have paid the hefty [subscription price](https://techcrunch.com/2024/03/26/tesla-fsd-beta-free-trial-promotion-driver-assistance/#:~:text=By%20expanding%20access%20to%20FSD,train%20its%20neural%20nets%20against.) for Tesla’s FSD, which currently costs $8,000 and has been [priced as high as $15,000](https://techcrunch.com/2022/08/21/tesla-increases-fsd-beta-cost-to-15000-in-north-america/). The pitch is that Dojo-trained AI software will eventually be pushed out to Tesla customers via over-the-air updates. The scale of FSD also means Tesla has been able to rake in millions of miles worth of video footage that it uses to train FSD. The idea there is that the more data Tesla can collect, the closer the automaker can get to actually achieving full self-driving. However, some industry experts say there might be a limit to the brute force approach of throwing more data at a model and expecting it to get smarter. “First of all, there’s an economic constraint, and soon it will just get too expensive to do that,” Anand Raghunathan, Purdue University’s Silicon Valley professor of electrical and computer engineering, told TechCrunch. Further, he said, “Some people claim that we might actually run out of meaningful data to train the models on. More data doesn’t necessarily mean more information, so it depends on whether that data has information that is useful to create a better model, and if the training process is able to actually distill that information into a better model.” Raghunathan said despite these doubts, the trend of more data appears to be here for the short-term at least. And more data means more compute power needed to store and process it all to train Tesla’s AI models. That is where Dojo, the supercomputer, comes in. What is a supercomputer? Dojo is Tesla’s supercomputer system that’s designed to function as a training ground for AI, specifically FSD. The name is a nod to the space where martial arts are practiced. A supercomputer is made up of thousands of smaller computers called nodes. Each of those nodes has its own CPU (central processing unit) and GPU (graphics processing unit). The former handles overall management of the node, and the latter does the complex stuff, like splitting tasks into multiple parts and working on them simultaneously. GPUs are essential for machine learning operations like those that power FSD training in simulation. They also power large language models, which is why the rise of generative AI has made Nvidia the most valuable company on the planet. Even Tesla buys Nvidia GPUs to train its AI (more on that later). Why does Tesla need a supercomputer? Tesla’s vision-only approach is the main reason Tesla needs a supercomputer. The neural networks behind FSD are trained on vast amounts of driving data to recognize and classify objects around the vehicle and then make driving decisions. That means that when FSD is engaged, the neural nets have to collect and process visual data continuously at speeds that match the depth and velocity recognition capabilities of a human. In other words, Tesla means to create a digital duplicate of the human visual cortex and brain function. To get there, Tesla needs to store and process all the video data collected from its cars around the world and run millions of simulations to train its model on the data. Tesla appears to rely on Nvidia to power its current Dojo training computer, but it doesn’t want to have all its eggs in one basket — not least because Nvidia chips are expensive. Tesla also hopes to make something better that increases bandwidth and decreases latencies. That’s why the automaker’s AI division decided to come up with its own custom hardware program that aims to train AI models more efficiently than traditional systems. At that program’s core is Tesla’s proprietary D1 chips, which the company says are optimized for AI workloads. Tell me more about these chips Tesla is of a similar opinion to Apple in that it believes hardware and software should be designed to work together. That’s why Tesla is working to move away from the standard GPU hardware and [design its own chips](https://techcrunch.com/2018/08/01/tesla-is-building-its-own-ai-chips-for-self-driving-cars/) to power Dojo. Tesla unveiled its D1 chip, a silicon square the size of a palm, on AI Day in 2021. The D1 chip entered into production as of at least May this year. The Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC) is manufacturing the chips using 7 nanometer semiconductor nodes. The D1 has 50 billion transistors and a large die size of 645 millimeters squared, according to Tesla. This is all to say that the D1 promises to be extremely powerful and efficient and to handle complex tasks quickly. “We can do compute and data transfers simultaneously, and our custom ISA, which is the instruction set architecture, is fully optimized for machine learning workloads,” said Ganesh Venkataramanan, former senior director of Autopilot hardware, at Tesla’s 2021 AI Day. “This is a pure machine learning.” The D1 is still not as powerful as Nvidia’s A100 chip, though, which is also manufactured by TSMC using a 7 nanometer process. The A100 contains 54 billion transistors and has a die size of 826 square millimeters, so it performs slightly better than Tesla’s D1. To get a higher bandwidth and higher compute power, Tesla’s AI team fused 25 D1 chips together into one tile to function as a unified computer system. Each tile has a compute power of 9 petaflops and 36 terabytes per second of bandwidth, and contains all the hardware necessary for power, cooling and data transfer. You can think of the tile as a self-sufficient computer made up of 25 smaller computers. Six of those tiles make up one rack, and two racks make up a cabinet. Ten cabinets make up an ExaPOD. At AI Day 2022, Tesla said Dojo would scale by deploying multiple ExaPODs. All of this together makes up the supercomputer. Tesla is also working on a next-gen D2 chip that aims to solve information flow bottlenecks. Instead of connecting the individual chips, the D2 would put the entire Dojo tile onto a single wafer of silicon. Tesla hasn’t confirmed how many D1 chips it has ordered or expects to receive. The company also hasn’t provided a timeline for how long it will take to get Dojo supercomputers running on D1 chips. In response to [a June post on X](https://x.com/SmokeAwayyy/status/1803645142987055342) that said: “Elon is building a giant GPU cooler in Texas,” Musk replied that Tesla was aiming for “half Tesla AI hardware, half Nvidia/other” over the next 18 months or so. The “other” could be AMD chips, per [Musk’s comment in January](https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1750997413920154011?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1750997413920154011%7Ctwgr%5Ee969c12df2e8aa4978143b33f2d0a0b1e2b4ad36%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redditmedia.com%2Fmediaembed%2F1abuhqv%2F%3Fresponsive%3Dtrueis_nightmode%3Dfalse). What does Dojo mean for Tesla? Taking control of its own chip production means that Tesla might one day be able to quickly add large amounts of compute power to AI training programs at a low cost, particularly as Tesla and TSMC scale up chip production. It also means that Tesla may not have to rely on Nvidia’s chips in the future, which are increasingly expensive and hard to secure. During Tesla’s second-quarter earnings call, Musk said that demand for Nvidia hardware is “so high that it’s often difficult to get the GPUs.” He said he was “quite concerned about actually being able to get steady GPUs when we want them, and I think this therefore requires that we put a lot more effort on Dojo in order to ensure that we’ve got the training capability that we need.” That said, Tesla is still buying Nvidia chips today to train its AI. In June, [Musk posted on X](https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1798055141670781107): Of the roughly $10B in AI-related expenditures I said Tesla would make this year, about half is internal, primarily the Tesla-designed AI inference computer and sensors present in all of our cars, plus Dojo. For building the AI training superclusters, Nvidia hardware is about 2/3 of the cost. My current best guess for Nvidia purchases by Tesla are $3B to $4B this year. “Inference compute” refers to the AI computations performed by Tesla cars in real time and is separate from the training compute that Dojo is responsible for. Dojo is a risky bet, one that Musk has hedged several times by saying that Tesla might not succeed. In the long run, Tesla could theoretically create a new business model based on its AI division. Musk has said that the first version of Dojo will be tailored for Tesla computer vision labeling and training, which is great for FSD and for training [Optimus](https://techcrunch.com/2024/07/23/elon-musk-sets-2026-optimus-sale-date-heres-where-other-humanoid-robots-stand/), Tesla’s humanoid robot. But it wouldn’t be useful for much else. [Musk has said](https://x.com/elonmusk/status/1671660883532038145) that future versions of Dojo will be more tailored to general-purpose AI training. One potential problem with that is almost all AI software out there has been written to work with GPUs. Using Dojo to train general-purpose AI models would require rewriting the software. That is, unless Tesla rents out its compute, similar to how AWS and Azure rent out cloud computing capabilities. Musk also noted during Q2 earnings that he sees “a path to being competitive with Nvidia with Dojo.” A September 2023 report from Morgan Stanley predicted that Dojo could [add $500 billion](https://www.cnn.com/2023/09/11/tech/tesla-dojo-morgan-stanley/index.html) to Tesla’s market value by unlocking new revenue streams in the form of robotaxis and software services. In short, Dojo’s chips are an insurance policy for the automaker, but one that could pay dividends. How far along is Dojo? [Reuters reported](https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/tesla-supercomputer-could-boost-ev-makers-market-cap-by-600-bln-morgan-stanley-2023-09-11/) last year that Tesla began production on Dojo in July 2023, but a [June 2023 post](https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1671700914548162561?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1671700914548162561%7Ctwgr%5E620fec03dde9591a01821fc9915002cb65d09840%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.teslarati.com%2Ftesla-elon-musk-confirms-dojo-now-online%2F) from Musk suggested that Dojo had been “online and running useful tasks for a few months.” Around the same time, Tesla said it expected Dojo to be one of the top five most powerful supercomputers by February 2024 — a feat that has yet to be publicly disclosed, leaving us doubtful that it has occurred. The company also said it expects Dojo’s total compute to reach 100 exaflops in October 2024. (One exaflops is equal to 1 quintillion computer operations per second. To reach 100 exaflops, and assuming that one D1 can achieve 362 teraflops, Tesla would need more than 276,000 D1s, or around 320,500 Nvidia A100 GPUs.) Tesla also pledged in January 2024 to [spend $500 million](https://techcrunch.com/2024/01/26/tesla-dojo-supercomputer-buffalo-factory-500-million/) to build a Dojo supercomputer at its gigafactory in Buffalo, New York. In May 2024, [Musk noted](https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1792421243024806156?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1792421243024806156%7Ctwgr%5Edf588154215a68a9da655bb35d9aac4dac1cdc2d%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.teslarati.com%2Felon-musk-tesla-supercomputer-cluster-giga-texas-location%2F) that the rear portion of Tesla’s Austin gigafactory will be reserved for a “super dense, water-cooled supercomputer cluster.” Now we know that it’s actually Cortex, not Dojo, that is taking up that space in Austin. Just after Tesla’s second-quarter earnings call, Musk [posted on X](https://x.com/elonmusk/status/1815860678210568480) that the automaker’s AI team is using Tesla HW4 AI computer (renamed AI4), which is the hardware that lives on Tesla vehicles, in the training loop with Nvidia GPUs. He noted that the breakdown is roughly 90,000 Nvidia H100s plus 40,000 AI4 computers. “And Dojo 1 will have roughly 8k H100-equivalent of training online by end of year,” he continued. “Not massive, but not trivial either.” Tesla hasn’t provided updates as to whether it has gotten those chips online and running Dojo. During the company’s fourth-quarter 2024 earnings call, no one mentioned Dojo. However, Tesla said it completed the deployment of Cortex in Q4 and that it was Cortex that helped enable V13 of supervised FSD.

79210150,Musk's pivot to U.S. airspace reform raises new conflict-of-interest concerns,"Elon Musk is CEO of Tesla and SpaceX and also leads President Donald Trump's DOGE group, which aims to make drastic cuts to the federal government.","[Elon Musk](https://www.cnbc.com/elon-musk/)'s involvement in [the Trump administration's airspace reform plan](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/02/05/dot-secretary-sean-duffy-elon-musk-airspace.html) has quickly spurred calls to bar the [Tesla](/quotes/TSLA/) and SpaceX leader from those efforts over his alleged conflicts of interest. U.S. Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy said Wednesday he spoke with Musk — who also leads President [Donald Trump](https://www.cnbc.com/donald-trump/)'s government-shrinking group DOGE — in the wake of a [deadly plane crash](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/02/04/all-67-victims-in-dc-plane-collision-recovered-officials-say.html) above Washington, D.C., last week. ""We're going to remake our airspace, and we're going to do it quickly,"" Duffy said after praising Musk as a ""pretty remarkable guy"" with ""access to the best technological people, the best engineers in the world."" Duffy later Wednesday wrote on Musk's social media site X that DOGE is ""going to plug in to help upgrade our aviation system."" Musk replied, ""With the support of President @realDonaldTrump, the @DOGE team will aim to make rapid safety upgrades to the air traffic control system."" But Sen. Maria Cantwell, the top Democrat on the committee that oversees air traffic control, said that Musk should not be allowed anywhere near those reform efforts. ""It's a clear conflict of interest,"" [Cantwell told reporters](https://x.com/cspan/status/1887540866799038717) Thursday. The senator from Washington state said Musk has been ""fined for violations."" She was referencing the Federal Aviation Administration proposing $633,000 in [civil penalties](https://www.faa.gov/newsroom/faa-proposes-633009-civil-penalties-against-spacex) against SpaceX last year over the company's alleged failures to follow licensing rules during two rocket launches in 2023. Musk had responded to that proposed fine by threatening to sue the FAA for ""regulatory overreach."" Days later, he publicly urged then-FAA chief Michael Whitaker to resign. Cantwell said, ""At a time when you need the FAA to call the shots and say, 'Don't launch now because there could be a conflict in the airspace,' the last thing I want is that guy trying to control the airspace."" Whitaker stepped down on Jan. 20, the day Trump took office, after running the agency for less than 15 months. The move left the FAA without a Senate-confirmed head for the first days of Trump's second term, including the day when the American Airlines flight collided with an Army Black Hawk helicopter in D.C. Trump appointed Christopher Rocheleau as acting FAA commissioner one day after the crash, which left 67 people dead. Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., sent Musk a letter last week [questioning his role](https://www.warren.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/warren-presses-musk-for-answers-on-his-role-in-resignation-of-faa-administrator) in Whitaker's resignation. [In a letter](https://www.commerce.senate.gov/services/files/D6E242D8-614E-4FF2-8FB4-EC79ACABF3DF) shared later Thursday, Cantwell asked Duffy to ""make sure that all conflicts of interest between the FAA and Elon Musk are removed."" Cantwell wrote to Duffy that during their most recent conversation, ""You did not discuss your intention to involve Elon Musk in the FAA's safety systems or process."" ""It is a conflict of interest for someone whose company is regulated by the federal government to be involved in anything that affects his personal financial interest, his company or his competitors,"" the senator wrote. Cantwell also noted that Whitaker had been unanimously confirmed by the Senate. — CNBC's Leslie Josephs contributed to this report.",cnbc.com,https://www.cnbc.com/2025/02/06/elon-musk-airspace-reform-conflict-senate-cantwell-duffy.html,['tsla'],"['Breaking News: Politics', 'Business', 'Computing', 'Consumer Cyclical', 'Elections', 'Government And Politics', 'Internet', 'Politics', 'Stock', 'Technology', 'Wireless']",2025-02-06,2025-02-06,1,11,77,147,3658

The top and bottom lines beat expectations and rose from the corresponding quarter of 2023. Uber’s full-year 2024 revenues grew 18% to $44 billion See the Zacks[ Earnings Calendar](https://www.zacks.com/earnings/earnings-calendar?art_rec=article-article_type-earnings_cal_link-earnings_cal-article_body) to stay ahead of market-making news. The stock, however, fell 7.5% as investors shunned the company’s strong 2024 earnings performance. The weak guidance for first-quarter 2025 led to the southward movement of shares. The market’s reaction may be perceived as a golden buying opportunity. Let’s explore. Highlights of UBER’s Q4 Earnings Uber’s fourth-quarter 2024 earnings per share of $3.21 outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 50 cents and improved more than 100% on a year-over-year basis. Total revenues of $11.9 billion beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $11.7 billion. The top line jumped 20.4% year over year on a reported basis and 21% on a constant currency basis. With economic activities returning to normal levels in the post-pandemic scenario, people are traveling to work and other places as before. As a result, UBER’s Mobility business has been seeing buoyant demand, with segmental revenues increasing 25% in the December quarter. With customer traffic picking up, gross bookings from the unit were highly impressive, aiding fourth-quarter results. Gross bookings from the Mobility segment in the December quarter increased 18% on a year-over-year basis to $22.8 billion. Uber’s Delivery business also performed well in the quarter, with segmental revenues growing 21% year over year. Gross bookings from the Delivery segment in the December quarter rose 18% on a year-over-year basis to $20.1 billion. Trips soared 18% to 3.1 billion or roughly 33 million trips per day on average. Monthly Active Platform Consumers increased 14% year over year to 171 million. Guidance Hurts UBER Stock Uber expects a strong dollar to hurt its first-quarter 2025 results. In the March quarter, gross bookings are anticipated to be in the $42 billion to $43.5 billion range, representing growth on a constant currency basis in the 17-21% band from first-quarter 2024 actuals. However, this wasn't enough to impress a market that was looking for a stronger momentum. The guidance includes an estimated 5.5 percentage point impact from a strong greenback. It implies a roughly 7 and 4 percentage point currency headwind to Mobility and Delivery growth, respectively. Our estimate for first-quarter 2025 gross bookings is currently pegged at $43.6 billion. Apart from currency headwinds, unfavorable winter weather might hurt trips and deliveries in the March quarter. The ride-hailing giant expects adjusted EBITDA in the $1.79 - $1.89 billion range, indicating 30% to 37% year-over-year growth. The projection also failed to satisfy investors. Challenges to Uber’s Autonomous Vehicle Ambitions Uber’s CEO Dara Khosrowshahi, on the fourth-quarter conference call, stated that while autonomous vehicle technology is advancing, commercialization will take significantly longer. Regulatory challenges may result in Uber taking longer to commercialize the autonomous vehicle business. Currently, Alphabet’s ([GOOGL](/stock/quote/GOOGL) - [Free Report](/registration/premium/login/?ALERT=zrmodule&mode=zramodule&t=GOOGL&ADID=ZCOM_ARTICLEBODY_TCK_ANALYSTBLOG_292_2411517_GOOGL&icid=BLOG-Analyst_Blog|Most_Popular_Stocks-2411517-free_report-commentary_body-text-GOOGL)) Waymo is the clear leader in the U.S. robotaxi space.

In fact, Uber shares have struggled of late due to robotaxi-related fears. Concerns that self-driving cars could eliminate intermediary services have been weighing on Uber shares lately, resulting in the stock declining in double-digits and underperforming its [industry](https://www.zacks.com/stocks/industry-rank/industry/internet-services-213) in the past three months.

In terms of price-to-earnings (forward 12-month), UBER is trading at 26.04X, higher than the industry’s 21.99X. Image Source: Zacks Investment Research How Should Investors Approach UBER Stock Now? Despite the market's reaction to Uber’s first-quarter 2025 gross bookings guidance and headwinds like high debt, Uber's fundamentals remain strong. Even though Uber’s primary business is ridesharing, it has diversified into food delivery and freight over time. Diversification is imperative for big companies to reduce risks, and UBER has excelled in this area. The company has engaged in numerous acquisitions, geographic and product diversifications, and innovations. Uber’s endeavors to expand into international markets are commendable and provide it with the benefits of geographical diversification. Prudent investments enable Uber to extend its services and solidify its comprehensive offerings. Uber’s scale, targeted market expansions and diversification strategies position it well for long-term growth, supporting the idea that its high valuation may be justified. Given its solid long-term potential (UBER’s long-term earnings (three to five years) growth rate is 36%, way ahead of its industry’s 22%), retaining this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock appears prudent. Meanwhile, new investors might consider waiting for a more attractive entry point.

Bessent’s department has been an early focus of the Department of Government Efficiency, the Musk-led effort to identify wasteful spending and modernize federal technology. Since President Donald Trump’s inauguration, DOGE has been instrumental in offering a buyout to civilian federal retirees, canceling government leases and contracts, and even dismantling the US Agency for International Development. But Bessent said the Internal Revenue Service would be largely spared from DOGE’s cost-cutting — at least until after the April 15 filing deadline, with customer-facing employees excluded from the government-wide deferred resignation program until mid-May.

The Alliance for Retired Americans, the American Federation of Government Employees and the Service Employees International Union sued the Treasury Department this week, asking the courts to block Musk’s access to the payment system run by Treasury’s Bureau of Fiscal Service.

79205470,Can Rivian Conquer Tesla? The Truth About This EV Underdog,"Rivian has an exciting product lineup, strong brand differentiation, and major backing from Amazon. However, it still faces hurdles in production scaling, profitability, and market competition.","Can Rivian Conquer Tesla? The Truth About This EV Underdog Image Source: [Pexels](https://www.pexels.com/photo/person-holding-white-and-blue-box-5716001/) [Rivian Automotive](https://rivian.com/) (Nasdaq: [RIVN](https://www.talkmarkets.com/symbol/RIVN)) is an electric vehicle (EV) manufacturer known for its adventure-friendly trucks and SUVs, such as the R1T pickup and R1S SUV. Unlike Tesla, which offers a broader range of EVs, including sedans and advanced autonomous driving features, Rivian focuses on rugged, off-road vehicles tailored for outdoor enthusiasts. But how does Rivian stand out from the competition, and is it a good stock to invest in? Let’s dive into the company’s operations, competitors, financial performance, and stock outlook. Rivian Video Overview Rivian’s Operations Founded in 2009, Rivian has positioned itself as a premium EV manufacturer catering to adventure seekers. Its vehicles boast impressive off-road capabilities, long-range battery options, and unique features like the “gear tunnel” for extra storage. Beyond consumer vehicles, Rivian has also ventured into commercial EVs, notably securing a contract with Amazon to produce electric delivery vans. However, scaling production has been a challenge, and Rivian has yet to turn a profit despite strong demand. Rivian vs. Its Competitors Rivian faces stiff competition from both legacy automakers and EV startups. Some of its biggest competitors include: - Tesla ( [TSLA](https://www.talkmarkets.com/symbol/TSLA)): The dominant EV player with global reach, Tesla has a profitable business model and cutting-edge technology. Its Cybertruck presents a direct challenge to Rivian’s R1T. - Ford ( [F](https://www.talkmarkets.com/symbol/F)): The F-150 Lightning, an electric version of America’s best-selling pickup, competes head-to-head with Rivian’s offerings. - General Motors ( [GM](https://www.talkmarkets.com/symbol/GM)): GM’s Hummer EV and upcoming electric Silverado add to the competition in the adventure and truck EV space. - Lucid Motors ( [LCID](https://www.talkmarkets.com/symbol/LCID)) & Other EV Startups: While Lucid focuses on luxury EV sedans, other startups are also entering the EV truck and SUV market, adding to the competitive pressure. What makes Rivian stand out? Its niche focus on outdoor adventure vehicles and its partnership with Amazon provide it with unique market positioning. However, achieving profitability and ramping up production remain key challenges. Rivian’s Financial Health and Recent Developments Rivian is still in the growth phase and has yet to be profitable. Unlike Tesla, which generates billions in earnings, Rivian is burning cash as it scales production. One of the most significant recent developments for Rivian is the $6.6 billion loan guarantee from the U.S. Department of Energy. This funding will support the construction of a new EV factory in Georgia, set to begin production in 2028. While this is a major step toward expansion, concerns remain about the future of government EV subsidies, especially under a new Trump administration. Technical Analysis of Rivian Rivian’s stock price has experienced significant volatility. Recently, the stock surged about 42.7% following news of the loan approval. However, it later dropped due to fears that the Trump administration could eliminate EV subsidies. The stock recently rebounded after Rivian announced plans to introduce a hands-free driving feature later this year. Looking at the daily chart, Rivian’s stock is currently in a downward trend. Here are some key technical indicators: - Mixed Signals: The future Ichimoku cloud is bullish but flattening, indicating uncertainty. - Death Cross: A bearish signal where the 50-day moving average crosses below the 200-day moving average. - Candlestick Positioning: The stock price is inside the Ichimoku cloud, suggesting indecision in the market. If you’re considering buying, here are key buy levels to consider: - $12.71 - $12.22 - $11.05 Investors may consider these levels for potential entry points, depending on their risk tolerance and investment goals. Remember: Investing is personal, and what is right for me might not be right for you. Always do your own due diligence. You should ONLY invest based on your own risk tolerance and your timeframe for reaching your portfolio goals. (Click on image to enlarge) Final Thoughts on Rivian Rivian has an exciting product lineup, strong brand differentiation, and major backing from Amazon. However, it still faces hurdles in production scaling, profitability, and market competition. The company’s ability to navigate these challenges will determine its long-term success. For investors, Rivian presents both opportunity and risk. Those with a high risk tolerance and long-term outlook may find value in its potential, while others may prefer to wait for clearer signs of financial stability before jumping in.

79204113,Tesla’s German Sales Plummet Amid Broader Political Backlash In Europe,"Tesla is experiencing a significant decline in European sales, particularly in Germany, due to backlash against CEO Elon Musk.","Tesla’s German Sales Plummet Amid Broader Political Backlash In Europe Image courtesy of [123rf.com](http://123rf.com/) Tesla (Nasdaq: [TSLA](https://www.talkmarkets.com/symbol/TSLA)) is facing [significant challenges in Europe](https://www.ft.com/content/ea2329e4-b4bc-4e2d-be34-e9a8ea31129c) as sales of its electric vehicles have sharply declined due to a backlash against CEO Elon Musk’s political involvement. The controversy stems from Musk’s [endorsement of the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) party](https://edition.cnn.com/2025/01/09/world/musk-livestream-afd-weidel-germany-intl/index.html), which has sparked criticism from German political leaders and raised concerns in Brussels about the influence of his social media platform, X. This political entanglement has coincided with a notable drop in Tesla’s market share across key European countries. Tesla Sales in Germany Down 59.5% y/y Amid Broader European Decline Tesla’s sales figures in Europe have taken a noticeable hit, particularly in Germany, where new car registrations have fallen by 59.5% compared to the previous year. This decline is striking, given that the overall electric vehicle market in Germany has grown by more than 50% during the same period. Similar trends are evident in other European countries, with sales in France and Norway dropping by 63% and 38%, respectively. The UK has also seen an 8% decrease in Tesla sales. While some analysts attribute this downturn to consumers potentially waiting for upgraded models, the impact of Musk’s political actions cannot be overlooked. Tesla’s stock has experienced fluctuations amid the ongoing controversy. The stock opened at $373.11 and is currently trading at $366.28, reflecting a downward trend. The day’s low was $363.18, while the high reached $375.4. The stock’s performance has been volatile, with a 52-week range between $138.8 and $488.54. Despite these fluctuations, Tesla maintains a substantial market capitalization of over $1.17 trillion. Analysts have issued a “hold” recommendation, with a target mean price of $332.98, indicating cautious optimism about the company’s future prospects. Tesla Stock Remains Shaky Recent historical data reveals a pattern of ups and downs in Tesla’s stock price. In January 2025, the stock saw a series of fluctuations, with notable peaks and troughs. For instance, the stock opened at $409.90 on January 15 and closed at $428.22, followed by a decline to $413.82 on January 16. The stock’s performance in late January and early February [continued to show variability](https://tokenist.com/investing/what-is-beta-in-stocks/), with closing prices ranging from $406.58 on January 24 to $392.21 on February 4. As Tesla navigates the challenges posed by declining sales in Europe and the political controversy surrounding its CEO, the company’s future remains uncertain. While some investors remain optimistic, as reflected in the analyst target prices, the broader implications of Musk’s political involvement and its impact on Tesla’s brand image could shape the company’s trajectory in the coming months.

And, at least for now, as the report notes, the trend appears to be following suit throughout the rest of Europe. In January, Tesla's new car registrations in Germany plunged 59.5% to 1,277, despite hosting its sole European factory. Sales also fell sharply in France (down 63%), Norway (38%), and the UK (8%) year-over-year, FT [writes](https://www.ft.com/content/ea2329e4-b4bc-4e2d-be34-e9a8ea31129c). EV sales ""slowed sharply in Germany and France"" last year after subsidy cuts but have recently started to rebound. Despite this, Tesla’s January sales fell, dropping its German market share from 14% to 4%, even as the overall EV market grew over 50%. Analysts cite anticipation for the updated Model Y in 2025 and backlash against Elon Musk’s political activities as possible reasons for the dropoff. Schmidt Automotive Research told the New York Times that buyers in Germany could be ""reacting to Musk’s comments” about politics in Europe. In California, Tesla’s largest U.S. market, new registrations also fell 11.6% in 2024, despite overall EV sales rising 1.2%, [per the California New Car Dealers Association and NYT](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/05/business/tesla-germany-elon-musk.html). Days ago, [Tesla reported](https://www.zerohedge.com/markets/tesla-spikes-despite-soft-q4-results-after-forecasting-vehicle-business-returning-growth) a softer expected Q4 2024, but Tesla stock has mostly held up in the interim. At the time, reactions were mixed, with some bearish: “It’s clear that the market was looking for better profitability and better guidance,” said Seth Goldstein of Morningstar. “We heard on the last earnings call 20% to 30% growth, and now it’s just ‘return to growth.’ People want more firm guidance: What is the plan, and how are you going to get there?” ...and others bullish: Cathie Wood said she thinks the stock reversal was fueled, in part, by the idea that Tesla will be scaling the Cybercab in 2026 and that production has to start this year. “We can see Tesla get down to a $15,000 car,” she said on a livestream on X spaces, noting a five-year time horizon. “This is nothing a traditional auto analyst can relate to.” Recall, [we reported late last year](https://www.zerohedge.com/political/last-spark-hope-germany-musk-pens-pro-afd-op-ed-major-paper-editor-resigns) when CEO Elon Musk penned a supportive op-ed for Germany's AfD party in the country’s Welt am Sonntag newspaper... prompting the resignation of the paper's editor.",zerohedge.com,https://www.zerohedge.com/markets/tesla-sales-fell-59-germany-january-ev-sales-across-europe-whipsawed,"['morn', 'tsla']","['Consumer Cyclical', 'Germany', 'Industrials', 'Stock', 'Tiingo Top']",2025-02-06,2025-02-06,2,5,79,83,2735

Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points ([see more details here](https://www.insidermonkey.com/premium/newsletters/quarterly)). Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:[TSLA](https://www.insidermonkey.com/insider-trading/company/tesla+inc/1318605/)) Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 99 Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) is an automotive and clean energy company that leverages advanced artificial intelligence in its autonomous driving technology and robotics initiatives. On February 6th, Wolfe reiterated the stock as “Peer Perform”, stating that Robotaxi is the key to Tesla’s business. However, it sees too many challenges for now. While the firm is cautious about Tesla’s near-term performance, it believes robotaxi performance will be a key driver for the stock this year. Its Q1 outlook appears difficult due to “seasonality and planned MY downtime,” and there is also uncertainty around Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA)’s upcoming affordable vehicle lineup. Despite visibility being low, analysts believe “margins could improve quickly”. The firm also noted that Tesla could be weighed down by regulatory risks. Nevertheless, the firm remains focused on Tesla’s autonomy efforts. “As it relates to stock, we remain on the sidelines, as we continue to view TSLA’s planned Robotaxi launch in June as the most important near-term catalyst. We fully expect Tesla to launch a rideshare service in Austin, as planned. Afterwards, we’d expect the market to start honing in on a several key service metric.” Overall, TSLA ranks 7th on our list of must-watch AI stocks dominating headlines. While we acknowledge the potential of TSLA as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame.

The most notable issue here seems to be Cybertruck demand. The Cybertruck was hyped up as having more than a million reservations. Yet, after around 30,000–40,000 sales, the truck’s reservation list seems to have been wiped out. And, now, Tesla seems to be having trouble drumming up demand for the vehicle. Adding to that narrative or assumption, Tesla emailed Tesla owners like me and presumably people who reserved a truck that you can now get your truck wrapped for free if you order a new Foundation Series Cybertruck by March 31, 2025. Clearly, the aim is to log more Q1 Cybertruck sales ASAP. Here’s the full text of the email, which had the headline “Get a Free Wrap for Your Cybertruck.” Whereas wraps from Tesla previously weren’t available outside of some specific areas of California, there don’t seem to be any geographic limitations to this. Some people are not going to be happy about me covering this, and especially in the way that I am. However, if you care about what’s happening at Tesla, it seems to me that you should like to be notified of and watching out for signs that vehicle sales are not going as hoped or planned. It seems to me that you would not want to block out that Cybertruck demand is not close to where it was expected to be, rather than find that out in a couple months or at the end of the year when the official numbers released by Tesla are a disappointment and a shock. That’s not to say that’s definitely the case. Perhaps the wrap offer was long in the plans and Tesla is just focusing on trying to land sales of its most expensive, high-margin models. Perhaps it’s all just a bit of fun. But the series of clues we have so far in 2025 are that Tesla is facing some consumer demand challenges, and particularly for its newest model, the Cybertruck. I’m calling it as a see it, just as I did for BMW, Chevrolet, Ford, and others in the past. Why ignore reality when it is going to prove itself eventually, and perhaps sooner than later? The good news for anyone who’s a big Cybertruck fan and has been on the line about ordering one: you can now get one wrapped at no extra charge from Tesla, if you are fine paying for a Foundation series model. And, on that note, if you need a Tesla owner’s referral code for a $1,000 discount, you’re free to use mine: [https://ts.la/zachary63404](https://ts.la/zachary63404) — hopefully you’re replacing a gas-powered pickup truck or SUV with that.

79201198,"Tesla sales crash in another market and this time, it can’t blame Model Y","Australia is the latest market to report a significant drop in Tesla sales for the first month of 2025, and...","Australia is the latest market to report a significant drop in Tesla sales for the first month of 2025, and in this case, the automaker can’t blame the Model Y changeover. Earlier this week, we reported on[ European markets releasing car sales data for January](https://electrek.co/2025/02/05/tesla-sales-dropped-60-in-germany/), showing a massive drop in Tesla sales. Tesla sold roughly half as many cars in Europe in January 2025 compared to January 2024. Most industry watchers agree that there are two main reasons behind the sharp decline: - Elon Musk’s meddling in politics and spreading misinformation on social media is driving people away from Tesla - Tesla is transitioning Model Y production to the new design, which is affecting production and sales Now, Australia is reporting its car sale numbers for January 2025, and it shows that Tesla is also having issues in this market. In the first month of 2025, Tesla delivered only 739 vehicles – down 33% year-over-year. This time, Tesla can’t blame the Model Y changeover as Model Y deliveries were actually up 20%. Model 3 is the problem. Sales of Tesla’s cheapest model were down 63%. This has been Tesla’s trend in Australia for the last year. In January 2023, Tesla delivered more than 2,000 vehicles in the country, but now it can only deliver a few hundred units. In 2024, Tesla’s sales dropped 17% for the whole year. Electrek’s Take Top comment by [Leo](#comments) Canadian sales will also decline substantially due to loss of EV incentive, higher prices, and political alienation. US sales will decline as well. In China they are being outcompeted by superior technology. Tesla sales in 2025 will be down at least 20% globally from 2024. They have enough cash to ride this out but they need to turn things around fast. [View all comments](#comments) At this point, it’s fairly clear that Tesla’s sales will be abysmal in Q1. Tesla will use the excuse of the Model Y changeover, and it will undoubtedly be partly true, but I think the Elon effect is also be a significant part of Tesla’s sales problem. Unfortunately, it’s impossible to calculate, but in the case of Australia, we can see that it’s part of the problem with the model breakdown. Australia is not a huge car market and it won’t have a major impact on Tesla, but the trend appears to be similar in most markets. The US is the biggest wildcard, as Elon still has a lot of fans there, obviously. US data is a bit more opaque and it will take a while for us to see an impact, if any.

Tesla Inc TSLA is one of the largest electric vehicle companies in the world, but it could be facing sales declines in parts of the world due to CEO Elon Musk's deeper [push into politics.](https://www.benzinga.com/news/global/25/01/43172806/tesla-lost-15-billion-in-brand-value-in-2024-report-says-did-elon-musks-political-push-hurt-ev-giant) What Happened: In recent weeks, sales data for electric vehicle sales in 2024 has shown Tesla's market share and overall unit sales declining in regions, including[ the United States.](https://www.benzinga.com/trading-ideas/25/01/42978236/us-electric-vehicle-sales-hit-record-1-3-million-units-in-2024-despite-tesla-declines-top-10-bestselling-models-list) Along with sales[ drops in California ](https://www.benzinga.com/trading-ideas/25/02/43447273/tesla-sales-drop-12-in-california-is-elon-musks-support-for-donald-trump-hurting-ev-sales)and the United States overall, Tesla's sales in Europe are taking a sharp hit. An Electrek [report](https://electrek.co/2025/02/05/tesla-sales-dropped-60-in-germany/), citing data from Reuters and German road traffic agency KBA, shows Tesla's sales of 1,277 units in Germany for the month of January, down 59.5% year-over-year. Sales are believed to be down due to the launch of the Model Y refresh and Musk's political push. While Tesla's sales were down 59.5% in January, the overall German automotive market was down 2.8%. Battery-electric vehicle sales were up 53.5% year-over-year in Germany in January, meaning this was likely a Tesla problem and not the overall EV market. Data shows sharp declines in the month of January across several European markets, which could be related to Musk's politics push and the Model Y update. Here are the sales figures below: - Germany: -59.5% - United Kingdom: -18.2% - France: -63.4% - Netherlands: -42.5% - Norway: -40.2% - Spain: -75.4% - Sweden: -46.0% - Denmark: -40.9% - Portugal: -31.0% The overall drop was 50.4% year-over-year in January for the countries above combined. Tesla sales were down 5.6% year-over-year in the United States in 2024, which came as the country set a record for EV sales for the year. In California, Tesla sales were down 12% year-over-year in 2024. Are you buying when the CEOs of the Magnificent 7 are selling? - Stay in the know with our Insider Trades page — [see when leaders like Mark Zuckerberg, Elon Musk, and Jensen Huang are offloading their own shares.](https://www.benzinga.com/sec/insider-trades/) Why It's Important: Musk has shown support for far-right German party Alternative for Germany and recently spoke virtually at[ the party's rally.](https://www.benzinga.com/news/global/25/01/43251316/tesla-faces-boycott-call-in-poland-over-musks-wwii-comments) During his appearance, Musk downplayed the importance of moving on from Germany's past, potentially referencing the Nazi party and World War II. “Children should not be guilty of the sins of their parents, let alone their great-grandparents,” Musk said, as reported by [Bloomberg](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-01-27/tesla-faces-call-for-boycott-in-poland-after-musk-s-germany-remarks?srnd=homepage-americas&sref=TBDibEcD). Musk said there is a “too much focus on past guilt” during his virtual appearance. The comments came as the 80th anniversary of the liberation of the Auschwitz concentration camp was being recognized across Europe. Polish Sports and Tourism Minister Slawomir Nitras called for a boycott in the country after Musk's comments. In Poland, Tesla is the number one EV company with 4,460 vehicles sold in 2024, significantly more than second place Mercedes-Benz (1,640). A Brand Finance survey showed Tesla's brand value declining $15 billion in 2024 dropping Tesla from 36th place to 18th place. In the survey, consumers were less likely to recommend or consider buying a Tesla vehicle with some users citing Musk's politics as the reason why. While Musk has plenty of Tesla fans that will stay loyal no matter what he does or says, data is showing that Musk's deeper push into politics in America and Europe could have a drastic impact on Tesla's sales and market share in regions around the world. TSLA Price Action: Tesla stock is down 3.2% to $366.19 on Thursday versus a 52-week trading range of $138.80 to $488.54. Tesla stock is now down 3.5% year-to-date in 2025, but remains up 97.8% over the past year.

79195115,Elon Musk-approved Tesla Full Self-Driving dataset doubled: what’s the state of FSD now?,The Tesla Full Self-Driving crowdsourced dataset that Elon Musk has approved has doubled since the CEO shared it last month....,"The Tesla Full Self-Driving crowdsourced dataset that Elon Musk has approved has doubled since the CEO shared it last month. What does it say about the state of Tesla’s Full Self-Driving program now? We have been complaining for years about Tesla’s lack of data on its Full Self-Driving program. In September 2024, [Tesla started releasing monthly AI/self-driving roadmap](https://electrek.co/2024/10/31/tesla-gives-update-on-self-driving-roadmap-v13-slips-more-promises/) updates and referenced improvements in some metrics that it wouldn’t even share. Unsurprisingly, Tesla quickly stopped releasing the monthly updates after missing several milestones. Because Tesla has not provided data, we have to rely on a less-than-ideal but better-than-nothing crowdsourced dataset. Tesla fans often criticized the dataset because it doesn’t make the Full Self-Driving system look great, but it’s harder to do now that Tesla CEO Elon Musk has positively referenced the dataset on two occasions. The last time Musk referenced the data, [he misrepresented it as confirming “exponential improvement” by singling out highway mileage](https://electrek.co/2025/01/13/elon-musk-misrepresents-data-that-shows-tesla-is-still-years-away-from-unsupervised-self-driving/). This was data back when Musk referenced it last month: Musk particularly praised the highway mileage of 723 miles between disengagement, which was a big jump over Tesla FSD v12, but we noted that this was misleading because v13 finally merged city and highway software stacks to include end-to-end neural nets. This had been delayed for highway driving for years. Therefore, Musk was trying to make this update look like an “exponential improvement” when, in fact, it was simply Tesla finally using years of development in city driving and transferring it to highway driving, which was supposed to have happened a long time ago. However, Musk’s approval of crowdsource data confirms that it is in the ballpark of what Tesla sees with FSD. Otherwise, it would be incredibly misleading for him to share it positively, even if he has misrepresented it to make it look positive. When Musk shared the data, there were only 8,000 miles on the new FSD v13 update. Now, [the crowdsource dataset](https://teslafsdtracker.com/) has almost twice as many miles on Tesla FSD v13. With more miles, the performance actually went down. Miles between disengagement on highway went from 723 to 624 miles. Tesla’s primary metric has been “miles between necessary disengagement,” which is currently 489 miles. The automaker previously claimed that [v13 would bring “5 to 6x improved miles between necessary interventions” compared to v12.5.](https://electrek.co/2024/10/24/elon-musk-just-said-some-wild-things-about-teslas-self-driving-rollout/) The average of all v12.5 updates is at 183 miles. Therefore, it’s actually closer to a 2.7x improvement. Where does Tesla need to go from there? Ashok Elluswamy, the head of FSD at Tesla, has previously stated that for Tesla to enable unsupervised self-driving, Tesla needs to achieve the average in miles per critical intervention “equivalent of human miles between collision,” which stands at 700,000 miles, according to NHTSA. Electrek’s Take Yes, a 15,000-mile dataset is quite limited, but you FSD fans can’t complain since Elon bragged about it with just 8,000 miles. 500 miles sounds about right to me. It means that Tesla would need a 1,400x improvement to achieve the level of safety it said it needs to achieve unsupervised self-driving. Anyone who thinks this is happening this year is kidding themselves. However, I believe that Tesla is working around that. Elon said that Tesla is launching “unsupervised self-driving as a paid service in Austin in June,” and he confirmed that it will be done with “Tesla’s internal fleet.” This means a Waymo-style geo-fenced autonomous ride-hailing system assisted by teleoperation – aka what Elon trashed for years and said that Tesla would easily surpassed with its approach. Top comment by [A98u723](#comments) I have no idea where these people get these numbers. This isn't even close to my abysmal experience. I've received three updates in rapid succession recently. It's so unreliable I literally disengage after just a few miles. On the first update, the car careened towards a guardrail within 60 seconds of engaging. I've switched to Auto Steer Beta because the performance is so poor. In reality, Auto Steer has regressed from when I first started as a guinea pig shortly after rollout. Pretty sure this crowdsourced data is entirely unreliable as it's fed by enthusiasts who are interested in the topic and want it to succeed. I also think the actual numbers are much worse than this inside Tesla or Musk would soil himself while blasting it on X instead of pointing to this as some sort of proof. Anything out of the mouth of Musk should be deeply discounted as misleading at best. [View all comments](#comments) You can deploy such a system with much lower miles between disengagement. Something like 10,000-20,000 miles is achievable, but the lower the mileage between disengagement, the messier it will be. In a limited geo-fenced environment, Tesla could possibly achieve that by June in Austin. The thing that Tesla fans need to understand is that this will only mean that Tesla will be where Waymo was years ago. It won’t get them closer to what Elon has been promising for years: unsupervised self-driving for the entire customer fleet built since 2016. Tesla would need to scale like Waymo is, which Elon has been claiming is not scalable. FTC: We use income earning auto affiliate links.
